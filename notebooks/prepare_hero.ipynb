      "Sherlock Holmes took his bottle from the corner of the mantelpiece and his hypodermic syringe from its neat morocco case.\n",
      "With his long, white, nervous fingers he adjusted the delicate needle, and rolled back his left shirt-cuff.\n",
      "For some little time his eyes rested thoughtfully upon the sinewy forearm and wrist all dotted and scarred with innumerable puncture-marks.\n",
      "Finally he thrust the sharp point home, pressed down the tiny piston, and sank back into the velvet-lined arm-chair with a long sigh of satisfaction.\n",
      "Three times a day for many months I had witnessed this performance, but custom had not reconciled my mind to it.\n",
      "On the contrary, from day to day I had become more irritable at the sight, and my conscience swelled nightly within me at the thought that I had lacked the courage to protest.\n",
      "Again and again I had registered a vow that I should deliver my soul upon the subject, but there was that in the cool, nonchalant air of my companion which made him the last man with whom one would care to take anything approaching to a liberty.\n",
      "His great powers, his masterly manner, and the experience which I had had of his many extraordinary qualities, all made me diffident and backward in crossing him.\n",
      "Yet upon that afternoon, whether it was the Beaune which I had taken with my lunch, or the additional exasperation produced by the extreme deliberation of his manner, I suddenly felt that I could hold out no longer.\n",
      "\"Which is it to-day?\"\n",
      "I asked,--\"morphine or cocaine?\"\n",
      "He raised his eyes languidly from the old black-letter volume which he had opened.\n",
      "\"It is cocaine,\" he said,--\"a seven-per-cent solution. Would you care to try it?\"\n",
      "\"No, indeed,\" I answered, brusquely.\n",
      "\"My constitution has not got over the Afghan campaign yet. I cannot afford to throw any extra strain upon it.\"\n",
      "He smiled at my vehemence.\n",
      "\"Perhaps you are right, Watson,\" he said.\n",
      "\"I suppose that its influence is physically a bad one. I find it, however, so transcendently stimulating and clarifying to the mind that its secondary action is a matter of small moment.\"\n",
      "\"But consider!\"\n",
      "I said, earnestly.\n",
      "\"Count the cost! Your brain may, as you say, be roused and excited, but it is a pathological and morbid process, which involves increased tissue-change and may at last leave a permanent weakness. You know, too, what a black reaction comes upon you. Surely the game is hardly worth the candle. Why should you, for a mere passing pleasure, risk the loss of those great powers with which you have been endowed? Remember that I speak not only as one comrade to another, but as a medical man to one for whose constitution he is to some extent answerable.\"\n",
      "He did not seem offended.\n",
      "On the contrary, he put his fingertips together and leaned his elbows on the arms of his chair, like one who has a relish for conversation.\n",
      "\"My mind,\" he said, \"rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work, give me the most abstruse cryptogram or the most intricate analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere. I can dispense then with artificial stimulants. But I abhor the dull routine of existence. I crave for mental exaltation. That is why I have chosen my own particular profession,--or rather created it, for I am the only one in the world.\"\n",
      "\"The only unofficial detective?\"\n",
      "I said, raising my eyebrows.\n",
      "\"The only unofficial consulting detective,\" he answered.\n",
      "\"I am the last and highest court of appeal in detection. When Gregson or Lestrade or Athelney Jones are out of their depths--which, by the way, is their normal state--the matter is laid before me. I examine the data, as an expert, and pronounce a specialist's opinion. I claim no credit in such cases. My name figures in no newspaper. The work itself, the pleasure of finding a field for my peculiar powers, is my highest reward. But you have yourself had some experience of my methods of work in the Jefferson Hope case.\"\n",
      "\"Yes, indeed,\" said I, cordially.\n",
      "\"I was never so struck by anything in my life. I even embodied it in a small brochure with the somewhat fantastic title of 'A Study in Scarlet.'\"\n",
      "He shook his head sadly.\n",
      "\"I glanced over it,\" said he.\n",
      "\"Honestly, I cannot congratulate you upon it. Detection is, or ought to be, an exact science, and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional manner. You have attempted to tinge it with romanticism, which produces much the same effect as if you worked a love-story or an elopement into the fifth proposition of Euclid.\"\n",
      "\"But the romance was there,\" I remonstrated.\n",
      "\"I could not tamper with the facts.\"\n",
      "\"Some facts should be suppressed, or at least a just sense of proportion should be observed in treating them. The only point in the case which deserved mention was the curious analytical reasoning from effects to causes by which I succeeded in unraveling it.\"\n",
      "I was annoyed at this criticism of a work which had been specially designed to please him.\n",
      "I confess, too, that I was irritated by the egotism which seemed to demand that every line of my pamphlet should be devoted to his own special doings.\n",
      "More than once during the years that I had lived with him in Baker Street I had observed that a small vanity underlay my companion's quiet and didactic manner.\n",
      "I made no remark, however, but sat nursing my wounded leg.\n",
      "I had a Jezail bullet through it some time before, and, though it did not prevent me from walking, it ached wearily at every change of the weather.\n",
      "\"My practice has extended recently to the Continent,\" said Holmes, after a while, filling up his old brier-root pipe.\n",
      "\"I was consulted last week by Francois Le Villard, who, as you probably know, has come rather to the front lately in the French detective service. He has all the Celtic power of quick intuition, but he is deficient in the wide range of exact knowledge which is essential to the higher developments of his art. The case was concerned with a will, and possessed some features of interest. I was able to refer him to two parallel cases, the one at Riga in 1857, and the other at St. Louis in 1871, which have suggested to him the true solution. Here is the letter which I had this morning acknowledging my assistance.\"\n",
      "He tossed over, as he spoke, a crumpled sheet of foreign notepaper.\n",
      "I glanced my eyes down it, catching a profusion of notes of admiration, with stray magnifiques, coup-de-maîtres and tours-de-force, all testifying to the ardent admiration of the Frenchman.\n",
      "\"He speaks as a pupil to his master,\" said I.\n",
      "\"Oh, he rates my assistance too highly,\" said Sherlock Holmes, lightly.\n",
      "\"He has considerable gifts himself. He possesses two out of the three qualities necessary for the ideal detective. He has the power of observation and that of deduction. He is only wanting in knowledge; and that may come in time. He is now translating my small works into French.\"\n",
      "\"Your works?\"\n",
      "\"Oh, didn't you know?\" he cried, laughing.\n",
      "\"Yes, I have been guilty of several monographs. They are all upon technical subjects. Here, for example, is one 'Upon the Distinction between the Ashes of the Various Tobaccoes.' In it I enumerate a hundred and forty forms of cigar-, cigarette-, and pipe-tobacco, with colored plates illustrating the difference in the ash. It is a point which is continually turning up in criminal trials, and which is sometimes of supreme importance as a clue. If you can say definitely, for example, that some murder has been done by a man who was smoking an Indian lunkah, it obviously narrows your field of search. To the trained eye there is as much difference between the black ash of a Trichinopoly and the white fluff of bird's-eye as there is between a cabbage and a potato.\"\n",
      "\"You have an extraordinary genius for minutiae,\" I remarked.\n",
      "\"I appreciate their importance. Here is my monograph upon the tracing of footsteps, with some remarks upon the uses of plaster of Paris as a preserver of impresses. Here, too, is a curious little work upon the influence of a trade upon the form of the hand, with lithotypes of the hands of slaters, sailors, corkcutters, compositors, weavers, and diamond-polishers. That is a matter of great practical interest to the scientific detective,--especially in cases of unclaimed bodies, or in discovering the antecedents of criminals. But I weary you with my hobby.\"\n",
      "\"Not at all,\" I answered, earnestly.\n",
      "\"It is of the greatest interest to me, especially since I have had the opportunity of observing your practical application of it. But you spoke just now of observation and deduction. Surely the one to some extent implies the other.\"\n",
      "\"Why, hardly,\" he answered, leaning back luxuriously in his armchair, and sending up thick blue wreaths from his pipe.\n",
      "\"For example, observation shows me that you have been to the Wigmore Street Post-Office this morning, but deduction lets me know that when there you dispatched a telegram.\"\n",
      "\"Right!\" said I. \"Right on both points! But I confess that I don't see how you arrived at it. It was a sudden impulse upon my part, and I have mentioned it to no one.\"\n",
      "\"It is simplicity itself,\" he remarked, chuckling at my surprise,--\"so absurdly simple that an explanation is superfluous; and yet it may serve to define the limits of observation and of deduction. Observation tells me that you have a little reddish mould adhering to your instep. Just opposite the Seymour Street Office they have taken up the pavement and thrown up some earth which lies in such a way that it is difficult to avoid treading in it in entering. The earth is of this peculiar reddish tint which is found, as far as I know, nowhere else in the neighborhood. So much is observation. The rest is deduction.\"\n",
      "\"How, then, did you deduce the telegram?\"\n",
      "\"Why, of course I knew that you had not written a letter, since I sat opposite to you all morning. I see also in your open desk there that you have a sheet of stamps and a thick bundle of postcards. What could you go into the post-office for, then, but to send a wire? Eliminate all other factors, and the one which remains must be the truth.\"\n",
      "\"In this case it certainly is so,\" I replied, after a little thought.\n",
      "\"The thing, however, is, as you say, of the simplest. Would you think me impertinent if I were to put your theories to a more severe test?\"\n",
      "\"On the contrary,\" he answered, \"it would prevent me from taking a second dose of cocaine. I should be delighted to look into any problem which you might submit to me.\"\n",
      "\"I have heard you say that it is difficult for a man to have any object in daily use without leaving the impress of his individuality upon it in such a way that a trained observer might read it. Now, I have here a watch which has recently come into my possession. Would you have the kindness to let me have an opinion upon the character or habits of the late owner?\"\n",
      "I handed him over the watch with some slight feeling of amusement in my heart, for the test was, as I thought, an impossible one, and I intended it as a lesson against the somewhat dogmatic tone which he occasionally assumed.\n",
      "He balanced the watch in his hand, gazed hard at the dial, opened the back, and examined the works, first with his naked eyes and then with a powerful convex lens.\n",
      "I could hardly keep from smiling at his crestfallen face when he finally snapped the case to and handed it back.\n",
      "\"There are hardly any data,\" he remarked.\n",
      "\"The watch has been recently cleaned, which robs me of my most suggestive facts.\"\n",
      "\"You are right,\" I answered.\n",
      "\"It was cleaned before being sent to me.\"\n",
      "In my heart I accused my companion of putting forward a most lame and impotent excuse to cover his failure.\n",
      "What data could he expect from an uncleaned watch?\n",
      "\"Though unsatisfactory, my research has not been entirely barren,\" he observed, staring up at the ceiling with dreamy, lack-lustre eyes.\n",
      "\"Subject to your correction, I should judge that the watch belonged to your elder brother, who inherited it from your father.\"\n",
      "\"That you gather, no doubt, from the H. W. upon the back?\"\n",
      "\"Quite so. The W. suggests your own name. The date of the watch is nearly fifty years back, and the initials are as old as the watch: so it was made for the last generation. Jewelry usually descents to the eldest son, and he is most likely to have the same name as the father. Your father has, if I remember right, been dead many years. It has, therefore, been in the hands of your eldest brother.\"\n",
      "\"Right, so far,\" said I. \"Anything else?\"\n",
      "\"He was a man of untidy habits,--very untidy and careless. He was left with good prospects, but he threw away his chances, lived for some time in poverty with occasional short intervals of prosperity, and finally, taking to drink, he died. That is all I can gather.\"\n",
      "I sprang from my chair and limped impatiently about the room with considerable bitterness in my heart.\n",
      "\"This is unworthy of you, Holmes,\" I said.\n",
      "\"I could not have believed that you would have descended to this. You have made inquires into the history of my unhappy brother, and you now pretend to deduce this knowledge in some fanciful way. You cannot expect me to believe that you have read all this from his old watch! It is unkind, and, to speak plainly, has a touch of charlatanism in it.\"\n",
      "\"My dear doctor,\" said he, kindly, \"pray accept my apologies. Viewing the matter as an abstract problem, I had forgotten how personal and painful a thing it might be to you. I assure you, however, that I never even knew that you had a brother until you handed me the watch.\"\n",
      "\"Then how in the name of all that is wonderful did you get these facts? They are absolutely correct in every particular.\"\n",
      "\"Ah, that is good luck. I could only say what was the balance of probability. I did not at all expect to be so accurate.\"\n",
      "\"But it was not mere guess-work?\"\n",
      "\"No, no: I never guess. It is a shocking habit,--destructive to the logical faculty. What seems strange to you is only so because you do not follow my train of thought or observe the small facts upon which large inferences may depend. For example, I began by stating that your brother was careless. When you observe the lower part of that watch-case you notice that it is not only dinted in two places, but it is cut and marked all over from the habit of keeping other hard objects, such as coins or keys, in the same pocket. Surely it is no great feat to assume that a man who treats a fifty-guinea watch so cavalierly must be a careless man. Neither is it a very far-fetched inference that a man who inherits one article of such value is pretty well provided for in other respects.\"\n",
      "I nodded, to show that I followed his reasoning.\n",
      "\"It is very customary for pawnbrokers in England, when they take a watch, to scratch the number of the ticket with a pin-point upon the inside of the case. It is more handy than a label, as there is no risk of the number being lost or transposed. There are no less than four such numbers visible to my lens on the inside of this case. Inference,--that your brother was often at low water. Secondary inference,--that he had occasional bursts of prosperity, or he could not have redeemed the pledge. Finally, I ask you to look at the inner plate, which contains the key-hole. Look at the thousands of scratches all round the hole,--marks where the key has slipped. What sober man's key could have scored those grooves? But you will never see a drunkard's watch without them. He winds it at night, and he leaves these traces of his unsteady hand. Where is the mystery in all this?\"\n",
      "\"It is as clear as daylight,\" I answered.\n",
      "\"I regret the injustice which I did you. I should have had more faith in your marvellous faculty. May I ask whether you have any professional inquiry on foot at present?\"\n",
      "\"None. Hence the cocaine. I cannot live without brain-work. What else is there to live for? Stand at the window here. Was ever such a dreary, dismal, unprofitable world? See how the yellow fog swirls down the street and drifts across the duncolored houses. What could be more hopelessly prosaic and material? What is the use of having powers, doctor, when one has no field upon which to exert them? Crime is commonplace, existence is commonplace, and no qualities save those which are commonplace have any function upon earth.\"\n",
      "I had opened my mouth to reply to this tirade, when with a crisp knock our landlady entered, bearing a card upon the brass salver.\n",
      "\"A young lady for you, sir,\" she said, addressing my companion.\n",
      "\"Miss Mary Morstan,\" he read.\n",
      "\"Hum! I have no recollection of the name. Ask the young lady to step up, Mrs. Hudson. Don't go, doctor. I should prefer that you remain.\"\n",
      "CHAPTER II The Statement of the Case\n",
      "Miss Morstan entered the room with a firm step and an outward composure of manner.\n",
      "She was a blonde young lady, small, dainty, well gloved, and dressed in the most perfect taste.\n",
      "There was, however, a plainness and simplicity about her costume which bore with it a suggestion of limited means.\n",
      "The dress was a sombre grayish beige, untrimmed and unbraided, and she wore a small turban of the same dull hue, relieved only by a suspicion of white feather in the side.\n",
      "Her face had neither regularity of feature nor beauty of complexion, but her expression was sweet and amiable, and her large blue eyes were singularly spiritual and sympathetic.\n",
      "In an experience of women which extends over many nations and three separate continents, I have never looked upon a face which gave a clearer promise of a refined and sensitive nature.\n",
      "I could not but observe that as she took the seat which Sherlock Holmes placed for her, her lip trembled, her hand quivered, and she showed every sign of intense inward agitation.\n",
      "\"I have come to you, Mr. Holmes,\" she said, \"because you once enabled my employer, Mrs. Cecil Forrester, to unravel a little domestic complication. She was much impressed by your kindness and skill.\"\n",
      "\"Mrs. Cecil Forrester,\" he repeated thoughtfully.\n",
      "\"I believe that I was of some slight service to her. The case, however, as I remember it, was a very simple one.\"\n",
      "\"She did not think so. But at least you cannot say the same of mine. I can hardly imagine anything more strange, more utterly inexplicable, than the situation in which I find myself.\"\n",
      "Holmes rubbed his hands, and his eyes glistened.\n",
      "He leaned forward in his chair with an expression of extraordinary concentration upon his clear-cut, hawklike features.\n",
      "\"State your case,\" said he, in brisk, business tones.\n",
      "I felt that my position was an embarrassing one.\n",
      "\"You will, I am sure, excuse me,\" I said, rising from my chair.\n",
      "To my surprise, the young lady held up her gloved hand to detain me.\n",
      "\"If your friend,\" she said, \"would be good enough to stop, he might be of inestimable service to me.\"\n",
      "I relapsed into my chair.\n",
      "\"Briefly,\" she continued, \"the facts are these. My father was an officer in an Indian regiment who sent me home when I was quite a child. My mother was dead, and I had no relative in England. I was placed, however, in a comfortable boarding establishment at Edinburgh, and there I remained until I was seventeen years of age. In the year 1878 my father, who was senior captain of his regiment, obtained twelve months' leave and came home. He telegraphed to me from London that he had arrived all safe, and directed me to come down at once, giving the Langham Hotel as his address. His message, as I remember, was full of kindness and love. On reaching London I drove to the Langham, and was informed that Captain Morstan was staying there, but that he had gone out the night before and had not yet returned. I waited all day without news of him. That night, on the advice of the manager of the hotel, I communicated with the police, and next morning we advertised in all the papers. Our inquiries let to no result; and from that day to this no word has ever been heard of my unfortunate father. He came home with his heart full of hope, to find some peace, some comfort, and instead--\"\n",
      "She put her hand to her throat, and a choking sob cut short the sentence.\n",
      "\"The date?\" asked Holmes, opening his note-book.\n",
      "\"He disappeared upon the 3d of December, 1878,--nearly ten years ago.\"\n",
      "\"His luggage?\"\n",
      "\"Remained at the hotel. There was nothing in it to suggest a clue,--some clothes, some books, and a considerable number of curiosities from the Andaman Islands. He had been one of the officers in charge of the convict-guard there.\"\n",
      "\"Had he any friends in town?\"\n",
      "\"Only one that we know of,--Major Sholto, of his own regiment, the 34th Bombay Infantry. The major had retired some little time before, and lived at Upper Norwood. We communicated with him, of course, but he did not even know that his brother officer was in England.\"\n",
      "\"A singular case,\" remarked Holmes.\n",
      "\"I have not yet described to you the most singular part. About six years ago--to be exact, upon the 4th of May, 1882--an advertisement appeared in the Times asking for the address of Miss Mary Morstan and stating that it would be to her advantage to come forward. There was no name or address appended. I had at that time just entered the family of Mrs. Cecil Forrester in the capacity of governess. By her advice I published my address in the advertisement column. The same day there arrived through the post a small card-board box addressed to me, which I found to contain a very large and lustrous pearl. No word of writing was enclosed. Since then every year upon the same date there has always appeared a similar box, containing a similar pearl, without any clue as to the sender. They have been pronounced by an expert to be of a rare variety and of considerable value. You can see for yourselves that they are very handsome.\"\n",
      "She opened a flat box as she spoke, and showed me six of the finest pearls that I had ever seen.\n",
      "\"Your statement is most interesting,\" said Sherlock Holmes.\n",
      "\"Has anything else occurred to you?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, and no later than to-day. That is why I have come to you. This morning I received this letter, which you will perhaps read for yourself.\"\n",
      "\"Thank you,\" said Holmes.\n",
      "\"The envelope too, please. Postmark, London, S.W. Date, July 7. Hum! Man's thumb-mark on corner,--probably postman. Best quality paper. Envelopes at sixpence a packet. Particular man in his stationery. No address. 'Be at the third pillar from the left outside the Lyceum Theatre to-night at seven o'clock. If you are distrustful, bring two friends. You are a wronged woman, and shall have justice. Do not bring police. If you do, all will be in vain. Your unknown friend.' Well, really, this is a very pretty little mystery. What do you intend to do, Miss Morstan?\"\n",
      "\"That is exactly what I want to ask you.\"\n",
      "\"Then we shall most certainly go. You and I and--yes, why, Dr. Watson is the very man. Your correspondent says two friends. He and I have worked together before.\"\n",
      "\"But would he come?\" she asked, with something appealing in her voice and expression.\n",
      "\"I should be proud and happy,\" said I, fervently, \"if I can be of any service.\"\n",
      "\"You are both very kind,\" she answered.\n",
      "\"I have led a retired life, and have no friends whom I could appeal to. If I am here at six it will do, I suppose?\"\n",
      "\"You must not be later,\" said Holmes.\n",
      "\"There is one other point, however. Is this handwriting the same as that upon the pearl-box addresses?\"\n",
      "\"I have them here,\" she answered, producing half a dozen pieces of paper.\n",
      "\"You are certainly a model client. You have the correct intuition. Let us see, now.\"\n",
      "He spread out the papers upon the table, and gave little darting glances from one to the other.\n",
      "\"They are disguised hands, except the letter,\" he said, presently, \"but there can be no question as to the authorship. See how the irrepressible Greek e will break out, and see the twirl of the final s. They are undoubtedly by the same person. I should not like to suggest false hopes, Miss Morstan, but is there any resemblance between this hand and that of your father?\"\n",
      "\"Nothing could be more unlike.\"\n",
      "\"I expected to hear you say so. We shall look out for you, then, at six. Pray allow me to keep the papers. I may look into the matter before then. It is only half-past three. Au revoir, then.\"\n",
      "\"Au revoir,\" said our visitor, and, with a bright, kindly glance from one to the other of us, she replaced her pearl-box in her bosom and hurried away.\n",
      "Standing at the window, I watched her walking briskly down the street, until the gray turban and white feather were but a speck in the sombre crowd.\n",
      "\"What a very attractive woman!\"\n",
      "I exclaimed, turning to my companion.\n",
      "He had lit his pipe again, and was leaning back with drooping eyelids.\n",
      "\"Is she?\" he said, languidly.\n",
      "\"I did not observe.\"\n",
      "\"You really are an automaton,--a calculating-machine!\"\n",
      "I cried.\n",
      "\"There is something positively inhuman in you at times.\"\n",
      "He smiled gently.\n",
      "\"It is of the first importance,\" he said, \"not to allow your judgment to be biased by personal qualities. A client is to me a mere unit,--a factor in a problem. The emotional qualities are antagonistic to clear reasoning. I assure you that the most winning woman I ever knew was hanged for poisoning three little children for their insurance-money, and the most repellant man of my acquaintance is a philanthropist who has spent nearly a quarter of a million upon the London poor.\"\n",
      "\"In this case, however--\"\n",
      "\"I never make exceptions. An exception disproves the rule. Have you ever had occasion to study character in handwriting? What do you make of this fellow's scribble?\"\n",
      "\"It is legible and regular,\" I answered.\n",
      "\"A man of business habits and some force of character.\"\n",
      "Holmes shook his head.\n",
      "\"Look at his long letters,\" he said.\n",
      "\"They hardly rise above the common herd. That d might be an a, and that l an e. Men of character always differentiate their long letters, however illegibly they may write. There is vacillation in his k's and self-esteem in his capitals. I am going out now. I have some few references to make. Let me recommend this book,--one of the most remarkable ever penned. It is Winwood Reade's Martyrdom of Man. I shall be back in an hour.\"\n",
      "I sat in the window with the volume in my hand, but my thoughts were far from the daring speculations of the writer.\n",
      "My mind ran upon our late visitor,--her smiles, the deep rich tones of her voice, the strange mystery which overhung her life.\n",
      "If she were seventeen at the time of her father's disappearance she must be seven-and-twenty now,--a sweet age, when youth has lost its self-consciousness and become a little sobered by experience.\n",
      "So I sat and mused, until such dangerous thoughts came into my head that I hurried away to my desk and plunged furiously into the latest treatise upon pathology.\n",
      "What was I, an army surgeon with a weak leg and a weaker banking-account, that I should dare to think of such things?\n",
      "She was a unit, a factor,--nothing more.\n",
      "If my future were black, it was better surely to face it like a man than to attempt to brighten it by mere will-o'-the-wisps of the imagination.\n",
      "CHAPTER III In Quest of a Solution\n",
      "It was half-past five before Holmes returned.\n",
      "He was bright, eager, and in excellent spirits,--a mood which in his case alternated with fits of the blackest depression.\n",
      "\"There is no great mystery in this matter,\" he said, taking the cup of tea which I had poured out for him.\n",
      "\"The facts appear to admit of only one explanation.\"\n",
      "\"What! you have solved it already?\"\n",
      "\"Well, that would be too much to say. I have discovered a suggestive fact, that is all. It is, however, very suggestive. The details are still to be added. I have just found, on consulting the back files of the Times, that Major Sholto, of Upper Norword, late of the 34th Bombay Infantry, died upon the 28th of April, 1882.\"\n",
      "\"I may be very obtuse, Holmes, but I fail to see what this suggests.\"\n",
      "\"No? You surprise me. Look at it in this way, then. Captain Morstan disappears. The only person in London whom he could have visited is Major Sholto. Major Sholto denies having heard that he was in London. Four years later Sholto dies. Within a week of his death Captain Morstan's daughter receives a valuable present, which is repeated from year to year, and now culminates in a letter which describes her as a wronged woman. What wrong can it refer to except this deprivation of her father? And why should the presents begin immediately after Sholto's death, unless it is that Sholto's heir knows something of the mystery and desires to make compensation? Have you any alternative theory which will meet the facts?\"\n",
      "\"But what a strange compensation! And how strangely made! Why, too, should he write a letter now, rather than six years ago? Again, the letter speaks of giving her justice. What justice can she have? It is too much to suppose that her father is still alive. There is no other injustice in her case that you know of.\"\n",
      "\"There are difficulties; there are certainly difficulties,\" said Sherlock Holmes, pensively.\n",
      "\"But our expedition of to-night will solve them all. Ah, here is a four-wheeler, and Miss Morstan is inside. Are you all ready? Then we had better go down, for it is a little past the hour.\"\n",
      "I picked up my hat and my heaviest stick, but I observed that Holmes took his revolver from his drawer and slipped it into his pocket.\n",
      "It was clear that he thought that our night's work might be a serious one.\n",
      "Miss Morstan was muffled in a dark cloak, and her sensitive face was composed, but pale.\n",
      "She must have been more than woman if she did not feel some uneasiness at the strange enterprise upon which we were embarking, yet her self-control was perfect, and she readily answered the few additional questions which Sherlock Holmes put to her.\n",
      "\"Major Sholto was a very particular friend of papa's,\" she said.\n",
      "\"His letters were full of allusions to the major. He and papa were in command of the troops at the Andaman Islands, so they were thrown a great deal together. By the way, a curious paper was found in papa's desk which no one could understand. I don't suppose that it is of the slightest importance, but I thought you might care to see it, so I brought it with me. It is here.\"\n",
      "Holmes unfolded the paper carefully and smoothed it out upon his knee.\n",
      "He then very methodically examined it all over with his double lens.\n",
      "\"It is paper of native Indian manufacture,\" he remarked.\n",
      "\"It has at some time been pinned to a board. The diagram upon it appears to be a plan of part of a large building with numerous halls, corridors, and passages. At one point is a small cross done in red ink, and above it is '3.37 from left,' in faded pencil-writing. In the left-hand corner is a curious hieroglyphic like four crosses in a line with their arms touching. Beside it is written, in very rough and coarse characters, 'The sign of the four,--Jonathan Small, Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan, Dost Akbar.' No, I confess that I do not see how this bears upon the matter. Yet it is evidently a document of importance. It has been kept carefully in a pocket-book; for the one side is as clean as the other.\"\n",
      "\"It was in his pocket-book that we found it.\"\n",
      "\"Preserve it carefully, then, Miss Morstan, for it may prove to be of use to us. I begin to suspect that this matter may turn out to be much deeper and more subtle than I at first supposed. I must reconsider my ideas.\"\n",
      "He leaned back in the cab, and I could see by his drawn brow and his vacant eye that he was thinking intently.\n",
      "Miss Morstan and I chatted in an undertone about our present expedition and its possible outcome, but our companion maintained his impenetrable reserve until the end of our journey.\n",
      "It was a September evening, and not yet seven o'clock, but the day had been a dreary one, and a dense drizzly fog lay low upon the great city.\n",
      "Mud-colored clouds drooped sadly over the muddy streets.\n",
      "Down the Strand the lamps were but misty splotches of diffused light which threw a feeble circular glimmer upon the slimy pavement.\n",
      "The yellow glare from the shop-windows streamed out into the steamy, vaporous air, and threw a murky, shifting radiance across the crowded thoroughfare.\n",
      "There was, to my mind, something eerie and ghost-like in the endless procession of faces which flitted across these narrow bars of light,--sad faces and glad, haggard and merry.\n",
      "Like all human kind, they flitted from the gloom into the light, and so back into the gloom once more.\n",
      "I am not subject to impressions, but the dull, heavy evening, with the strange business upon which we were engaged, combined to make me nervous and depressed.\n",
      "I could see from Miss Morstan's manner that she was suffering from the same feeling.\n",
      "Holmes alone could rise superior to petty influences.\n",
      "He held his open note-book upon his knee, and from time to time he jotted down figures and memoranda in the light of his pocket-lantern.\n",
      "At the Lyceum Theatre the crowds were already thick at the side-entrances.\n",
      "In front a continuous stream of hansoms and four-wheelers were rattling up, discharging their cargoes of shirt-fronted men and beshawled, bediamonded women.\n",
      "We had hardly reached the third pillar, which was our rendezvous, before a small, dark, brisk man in the dress of a coachman accosted us.\n",
      "\"Are you the parties who come with Miss Morstan?\" he asked.\n",
      "\"I am Miss Morstan, and these two gentlemen are my friends,\" said she.\n",
      "He bent a pair of wonderfully penetrating and questioning eyes upon us.\n",
      "\"You will excuse me, miss,\" he said with a certain dogged manner, \"but I was to ask you to give me your word that neither of your companions is a police-officer.\"\n",
      "\"I give you my word on that,\" she answered.\n",
      "He gave a shrill whistle, on which a street Arab led across a four-wheeler and opened the door.\n",
      "The man who had addressed us mounted to the box, while we took our places inside.\n",
      "We had hardly done so before the driver whipped up his horse, and we plunged away at a furious pace through the foggy streets.\n",
      "The situation was a curious one.\n",
      "We were driving to an unknown place, on an unknown errand.\n",
      "Yet our invitation was either a complete hoax,--which was an inconceivable hypothesis,--or else we had good reason to think that important issues might hang upon our journey.\n",
      "Miss Morstan's demeanor was as resolute and collected as ever.\n",
      "I endeavored to cheer and amuse her by reminiscences of my adventures in Afghanistan; but, to tell the truth, I was myself so excited at our situation and so curious as to our destination that my stories were slightly involved.\n",
      "To this day she declares that I told her one moving anecdote as to how a musket looked into my tent at the dead of night, and how I fired a double-barrelled tiger cub at it.\n",
      "At first I had some idea as to the direction in which we were driving; but soon, what with our pace, the fog, and my own limited knowledge of London, I lost my bearings, and knew nothing, save that we seemed to be going a very long way.\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes was never at fault, however, and he muttered the names as the cab rattled through squares and in and out by tortuous by-streets.\n",
      "\"Rochester Row,\" said he.\n",
      "\"Now Vincent Square. Now we come out on the Vauxhall Bridge Road. We are making for the Surrey side, apparently. Yes, I thought so. Now we are on the bridge. You can catch glimpses of the river.\"\n",
      "We did indeed bet a fleeting view of a stretch of the Thames with the lamps shining upon the broad, silent water; but our cab dashed on, and was soon involved in a labyrinth of streets upon the other side.\n",
      "\"Wordsworth Road,\" said my companion.\n",
      "\"Priory Road. Lark Hall Lane. Stockwell Place. Robert Street. Cold Harbor Lane. Our quest does not appear to take us to very fashionable regions.\"\n",
      "We had, indeed, reached a questionable and forbidding neighborhood.\n",
      "Long lines of dull brick houses were only relieved by the coarse glare and tawdry brilliancy of public houses at the corner.\n",
      "Then came rows of two-storied villas each with a fronting of miniature garden, and then again interminable lines of new staring brick buildings,--the monster tentacles which the giant city was throwing out into the country.\n",
      "At last the cab drew up at the third house in a new terrace.\n",
      "None of the other houses were inhabited, and that at which we stopped was as dark as its neighbors, save for a single glimmer in the kitchen window.\n",
      "On our knocking, however, the door was instantly thrown open by a Hindoo servant clad in a yellow turban, white loose-fitting clothes, and a yellow sash.\n",
      "There was something strangely incongruous in this Oriental figure framed in the commonplace door-way of a third-rate suburban dwelling-house.\n",
      "\"The Sahib awaits you,\" said he, and even as he spoke there came a high piping voice from some inner room.\n",
      "\"Show them in to me, khitmutgar,\" it cried.\n",
      "\"Show them straight in to me.\"\n",
      "CHAPTER IV The Story of the Bald-Headed Man\n",
      "We followed the Indian down a sordid and common passage, ill lit and worse furnished, until he came to a door upon the right, which he threw open.\n",
      "A blaze of yellow light streamed out upon us, and in the centre of the glare there stood a small man with a very high head, a bristle of red hair all round the fringe of it, and a bald, shining scalp which shot out from among it like a mountain-peak from fir-trees.\n",
      "He writhed his hands together as he stood, and his features were in a perpetual jerk, now smiling, now scowling, but never for an instant in repose.\n",
      "Nature had given him a pendulous lip, and a too visible line of yellow and irregular teeth, which he strove feebly to conceal by constantly passing his hand over the lower part of his face.\n",
      "In spite of his obtrusive baldness, he gave the impression of youth.\n",
      "In point of fact he had just turned his thirtieth year.\n",
      "\"Your servant, Miss Morstan,\" he kept repeating, in a thin, high voice.\n",
      "\"Your servant, gentlemen. Pray step into my little sanctum. A small place, miss, but furnished to my own liking. An oasis of art in the howling desert of South London.\"\n",
      "We were all astonished by the appearance of the apartment into which he invited us.\n",
      "In that sorry house it looked as out of place as a diamond of the first water in a setting of brass.\n",
      "The richest and glossiest of curtains and tapestries draped the walls, looped back here and there to expose some richly-mounted painting or Oriental vase.\n",
      "The carpet was of amber-and-black, so soft and so thick that the foot sank pleasantly into it, as into a bed of moss.\n",
      "Two great tiger-skins thrown athwart it increased the suggestion of Eastern luxury, as did a huge hookah which stood upon a mat in the corner.\n",
      "A lamp in the fashion of a silver dove was hung from an almost invisible golden wire in the centre of the room.\n",
      "As it burned it filled the air with a subtle and aromatic odor.\n",
      "\"Mr. Thaddeus Sholto,\" said the little man, still jerking and smiling.\n",
      "\"That is my name. You are Miss Morstan, of course. And these gentlemen--\"\n",
      "\"This is Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and this is Dr. Watson.\"\n",
      "\"A doctor, eh?\" cried he, much excited.\n",
      "\"Have you your stethoscope? Might I ask you--would you have the kindness? I have grave doubts as to my mitral valve, if you would be so very good. The aortic I may rely upon, but I should value your opinion upon the mitral.\"\n",
      "I listened to his heart, as requested, but was unable to find anything amiss, save indeed that he was in an ecstasy of fear, for he shivered from head to foot.\n",
      "\"It appears to be normal,\" I said.\n",
      "\"You have no cause for uneasiness.\"\n",
      "\"You will excuse my anxiety, Miss Morstan,\" he remarked, airily.\n",
      "\"I am a great sufferer, and I have long had suspicions as to that valve. I am delighted to hear that they are unwarranted. Had your father, Miss Morstan, refrained from throwing a strain upon his heart, he might have been alive now.\"\n",
      "I could have struck the man across the face, so hot was I at this callous and off-hand reference to so delicate a matter.\n",
      "Miss Morstan sat down, and her face grew white to the lips.\n",
      "\"I knew in my heart that he was dead,\" said she.\n",
      "\"I can give you every information,\" said he, \"and, what is more, I can do you justice; and I will, too, whatever Brother Bartholomew may say. I am so glad to have your friends here, not only as an escort to you, but also as witnesses to what I am about to do and say. The three of us can show a bold front to Brother Bartholomew. But let us have no outsiders,--no police or officials. We can settle everything satisfactorily among ourselves, without any interference. Nothing would annoy Brother Bartholomew more than any publicity.\"\n",
      "He sat down upon a low settee and blinked at us inquiringly with his weak, watery blue eyes.\n",
      "\"For my part,\" said Holmes, \"whatever you may choose to say will go no further.\"\n",
      "I nodded to show my agreement.\n",
      "\"That is well! That is well!\" said he.\n",
      "\"May I offer you a glass of Chianti, Miss Morstan? Or of Tokay? I keep no other wines. Shall I open a flask? No? Well, then, I trust that you have no objection to tobacco-smoke, to the mild balsamic odor of the Eastern tobacco. I am a little nervous, and I find my hookah an invaluable sedative.\"\n",
      "He applied a taper to the great bowl, and the smoke bubbled merrily through the rose-water.\n",
      "We sat all three in a semicircle, with our heads advanced, and our chins upon our hands, while the strange, jerky little fellow, with his high, shining head, puffed uneasily in the centre.\n",
      "\"When I first determined to make this communication to you,\" said he, \"I might have given you my address, but I feared that you might disregard my request and bring unpleasant people with you. I took the liberty, therefore, of making an appointment in such a way that my man Williams might be able to see you first. I have complete confidence in his discretion, and he had orders, if he were dissatisfied, to proceed no further in the matter. You will excuse these precautions, but I am a man of somewhat retiring, and I might even say refined, tastes, and there is nothing more unaesthetic than a policeman. I have a natural shrinking from all forms of rough materialism. I seldom come in contact with the rough crowd. I live, as you see, with some little atmosphere of elegance around me. I may call myself a patron of the arts. It is my weakness. The landscape is a genuine Corot, and, though a connoisseur might perhaps throw a doubt upon that Salvator Rosa, there cannot be the least question about the Bouguereau. I am partial to the modern French school.\"\n",
      "\"You will excuse me, Mr. Sholto,\" said Miss Morstan, \"but I am here at your request to learn something which you desire to tell me. It is very late, and I should desire the interview to be as short as possible.\"\n",
      "\"At the best it must take some time,\" he answered; \"for we shall certainly have to go to Norwood and see Brother Bartholomew. We shall all go and try if we can get the better of Brother Bartholomew. He is very angry with me for taking the course which has seemed right to me. I had quite high words with him last night. You cannot imagine what a terrible fellow he is when he is angry.\"\n",
      "\"If we are to go to Norwood it would perhaps be as well to start at once,\" I ventured to remark.\n",
      "He laughed until his ears were quite red.\n",
      "\"That would hardly do,\" he cried.\n",
      "\"I don't know what he would say if I brought you in that sudden way.\n",
      "No, I must prepare you by showing you how we all stand to each other.\n",
      "In the first place, I must tell you that there are several points in the story of which I am myself ignorant.\n",
      "I can only lay the facts before you as far as I know them myself.\n",
      "\"My father was, as you may have guessed, Major John Sholto, once of the Indian army.\n",
      "He retired some eleven years ago, and came to live at Pondicherry Lodge in Upper Norwood.\n",
      "He had prospered in India, and brought back with him a considerable sum of money, a large collection of valuable curiosities, and a staff of native servants.\n",
      "With these advantages he bought himself a house, and lived in great luxury.\n",
      "My twin-brother Bartholomew and I were the only children.\n",
      "\"I very well remember the sensation which was caused by the disappearance of Captain Morstan.\n",
      "We read the details in the papers, and, knowing that he had been a friend of our father's, we discussed the case freely in his presence.\n",
      "He used to join in our speculations as to what could have happened.\n",
      "Never for an instant did we suspect that he had the whole secret hidden in his own breast,--that of all men he alone knew the fate of Arthur Morstan.\n",
      "\"We did know, however, that some mystery--some positive danger--overhung our father.\n",
      "He was very fearful of going out alone, and he always employed two prize-fighters to act as porters at Pondicherry Lodge.\n",
      "Williams, who drove you to-night, was one of them.\n",
      "He was once light-weight champion of England.\n",
      "Our father would never tell us what it was he feared, but he had a most marked aversion to men with wooden legs.\n",
      "On one occasion he actually fired his revolver at a wooden-legged man, who proved to be a harmless tradesman canvassing for orders.\n",
      "We had to pay a large sum to hush the matter up.\n",
      "My brother and I used to think this a mere whim of my father's, but events have since led us to change our opinion.\n",
      "\"Early in 1882 my father received a letter from India which was a great shock to him.\n",
      "He nearly fainted at the breakfast-table when he opened it, and from that day he sickened to his death.\n",
      "What was in the letter we could never discover, but I could see as he held it that it was short and written in a scrawling hand.\n",
      "He had suffered for years from an enlarged spleen, but he now became rapidly worse, and towards the end of April we were informed that he was beyond all hope, and that he wished to make a last communication to us.\n",
      "\"When we entered his room he was propped up with pillows and breathing heavily.\n",
      "He besought us to lock the door and to come upon either side of the bed.\n",
      "Then, grasping our hands, he made a remarkable statement to us, in a voice which was broken as much by emotion as by pain.\n",
      "I shall try and give it to you in his own very words.\n",
      "\"'I have only one thing,' he said, 'which weighs upon my mind at this supreme moment. It is my treatment of poor Morstan's orphan.\n",
      "The cursed greed which has been my besetting sin through life has withheld from her the treasure, half at least of which should have been hers.\n",
      "And yet I have made no use of it myself,--so blind and foolish a thing is avarice.\n",
      "The mere feeling of possession has been so dear to me that I could not bear to share it with another.\n",
      "See that chaplet dipped with pearls beside the quinine-bottle.\n",
      "Even that I could not bear to part with, although I had got it out with the design of sending it to her.\n",
      "You, my sons, will give her a fair share of the Agra treasure.\n",
      "But send her nothing--not even the chaplet--until I am gone.\n",
      "After all, men have been as bad as this and have recovered.\n",
      "\"'I will tell you how Morstan died,' he continued.\n",
      "'He had suffered for years from a weak heart, but he concealed it from every one. I alone knew it. When in India, he and I, through a remarkable chain of circumstances, came into possession of a considerable treasure. I brought it over to England, and on the night of Morstan's arrival he came straight over here to claim his share.\n",
      "He walked over from the station, and was admitted by my faithful Lal Chowdar, who is now dead.\n",
      "Morstan and I had a difference of opinion as to the division of the treasure, and we came to heated words.\n",
      "Morstan had sprung out of his chair in a paroxysm of anger, when he suddenly pressed his hand to his side, his face turned a dusky hue, and he fell backwards, cutting his head against the corner of the treasure-chest.\n",
      "When I stooped over him I found, to my horror, that he was dead.\n",
      "\"'For a long time I sat half distracted, wondering what I should do.\n",
      "My first impulse was, of course, to call for assistance; but I could not but recognize that there was every chance that I would be accused of his murder.\n",
      "His death at the moment of a quarrel, and the gash in his head, would be black against me.\n",
      "Again, an official inquiry could not be made without bringing out some facts about the treasure, which I was particularly anxious to keep secret.\n",
      "He had told me that no soul upon earth knew where he had gone.\n",
      "There seemed to be no necessity why any soul ever should know.\n",
      "\"'I was still pondering over the matter, when, looking up, I saw my servant, Lal Chowdar, in the doorway. He stole in and bolted the door behind him. \"Do not fear, Sahib,\" he said. \"No one need know that you have killed him.\n",
      "Let us hide him away, and who is the wiser?\" \"I did not kill him,\" said I. Lal Chowdar shook his head and smiled. \"I heard it all, Sahib,\" said he. \"I heard you quarrel, and I heard the blow.\n",
      "But my lips are sealed.\n",
      "All are asleep in the house.\n",
      "Let us put him away together.\n",
      "\" That was enough to decide met.\n",
      "If my own servant could not believe my innocence, how could I hope to make it good before twelve foolish tradesmen in a jury-box?\n",
      "Lal Chowdar and I disposed of the body that night, and within a few days the London papers were full of the mysterious disappearance of Captain Morstan.\n",
      "You will see from what I say that I can hardly be blamed in the matter.\n",
      "My fault lies in the fact that we concealed not only the body, but also the treasure, and that I have clung to Morstan's share as well as to my own.\n",
      "I wish you, therefore, to make restitution.\n",
      "Put your ears down to my mouth.\n",
      "The treasure is hidden in--At this instant a horrible change came over his expression; his eyes stared wildly, his jaw dropped, and he yelled, in a voice which I can never forget, 'Keep him out!\n",
      "For Christ's sake keep him out'!\n",
      "We both stared round at the window behind us upon which his gaze was fixed.\n",
      "A face was looking in at us out of the darkness.\n",
      "We could see the whitening of the nose where it was pressed against the glass.\n",
      "It was a bearded, hairy face, with wild cruel eyes and an expression of concentrated malevolence.\n",
      "My brother and I rushed towards the window, but the man was gone.\n",
      "When we returned to my father his head had dropped and his pulse had ceased to beat.\n",
      "\"We searched the garden that night, but found no sign of the intruder, save that just under the window a single footmark was visible in the flower-bed. But for that one trace, we might have thought that our imaginations had conjured up that wild, fierce face. We soon, however, had another and a more striking proof that there were secret agencies at work all round us. The window of my father's room was found open in the morning, his cupboards and boxes had been rifled, and upon his chest was fixed a torn piece of paper, with the words 'The sign of the four' scrawled across it. What the phrase meant, or who our secret visitor may have been, we never knew. As far as we can judge, none of my father's property had been actually stolen, though everything had been turned out. My brother and I naturally associated this peculiar incident with the fear which haunted my father during his life; but it is still a complete mystery to us.\"\n",
      "The little man stopped to relight his hookah and puffed thoughtfully for a few moments.\n",
      "We had all sat absorbed, listening to his extraordinary narrative.\n",
      "At the short account of her father's death Miss Morstan had turned deadly white, and for a moment I feared that she was about to faint.\n",
      "She rallied however, on drinking a glass of water which I quietly poured out for her from a Venetian carafe upon the side-table.\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair with an abstracted expression and the lids drawn low over his glittering eyes.\n",
      "As I glanced at him I could not but think how on that very day he had complained bitterly of the commonplaceness of life.\n",
      "Here at least was a problem which would tax his sagacity to the utmost.\n",
      "Mr. Thaddeus Sholto looked from one to the other of us with an obvious pride at the effect which his story had produced, and then continued between the puffs of his overgrown pipe.\n",
      "\"My brother and I,\" said he, \"were, as you may imagine, much excited as to the treasure which my father had spoken of. For weeks and for months we dug and delved in every part of the garden, without discovering its whereabouts. It was maddening to think that the hiding-place was on his very lips at the moment that he died. We could judge the splendor of the missing riches by the chaplet which he had taken out. Over this chaplet my brother Bartholomew and I had some little discussion. The pearls were evidently of great value, and he was averse to part with them, for, between friends, my brother was himself a little inclined to my father's fault. He thought, too, that if we parted with the chaplet it might give rise to gossip and finally bring us into trouble. It was all that I could do to persuade him to let me find out Miss Morstan's address and send her a detached pearl at fixed intervals, so that at least she might never feel destitute.\"\n",
      "\"It was a kindly thought,\" said our companion, earnestly.\n",
      "\"It was extremely good of you.\"\n",
      "The little man waved his hand deprecatingly.\n",
      "\"We were your trustees,\" he said.\n",
      "\"That was the view which I took of it, though Brother Bartholomew could not altogether see it in that light. We had plenty of money ourselves. I desired no more. Besides, it would have been such bad taste to have treated a young lady in so scurvy a fashion. 'Le mauvais goût mène au crime.' The French have a very neat way of putting these things. Our difference of opinion on this subject went so far that I thought it best to set up rooms for myself: so I left Pondicherry Lodge, taking the old khitmutgar and Williams with me. Yesterday, however, I learn that an event of extreme importance has occurred. The treasure has been discovered. I instantly communicated with Miss Morstan, and it only remains for us to drive out to Norwood and demand our share. I explained my views last night to Brother Bartholomew: so we shall be expected, if not welcome, visitors.\"\n",
      "Mr. Thaddeus Sholto ceased, and sat twitching on his luxurious settee.\n",
      "We all remained silent, with our thoughts upon the new development which the mysterious business had taken.\n",
      "Holmes was the first to spring to his feet.\n",
      "\"You have done well, sir, from first to last,\" said he.\n",
      "\"It is possible that we may be able to make you some small return by throwing some light upon that which is still dark to you. But, as Miss Morstan remarked just now, it is late, and we had best put the matter through without delay.\"\n",
      "Our new acquaintance very deliberately coiled up the tube of his hookah, and produced from behind a curtain a very long befrogged topcoat with Astrakhan collar and cuffs.\n",
      "This he buttoned tightly up, in spite of the extreme closeness of the night, and finished his attire by putting on a rabbit-skin cap with hanging lappets which covered the ears, so that no part of him was visible save his mobile and peaky face.\n",
      "\"My health is somewhat fragile,\" he remarked, as he led the way down the passage.\n",
      "\"I am compelled to be a valetudinarian.\"\n",
      "Our cab was awaiting us outside, and our programme was evidently prearranged, for the driver started off at once at a rapid pace.\n",
      "Thaddeus Sholto talked incessantly, in a voice which rose high above the rattle of the wheels.\n",
      "\"Bartholomew is a clever fellow,\" said he.\n",
      "\"How do you think he found out where the treasure was? He had come to the conclusion that it was somewhere indoors: so he worked out all the cubic space of the house, and made measurements everywhere, so that not one inch should be unaccounted for. Among other things, he found that the height of the building was seventy-four feet, but on adding together the heights of all the separate rooms, and making every allowance for the space between, which he ascertained by borings, he could not bring the total to more than seventy feet. There were four feet unaccounted for. These could only be at the top of the building. He knocked a hole, therefore, in the lath-and-plaster ceiling of the highest room, and there, sure enough, he came upon another little garret above it, which had been sealed up and was known to no one. In the centre stood the treasure-chest, resting upon two rafters. He lowered it through the hole, and there it lies. He computes the value of the jewels at not less than half a million sterling.\"\n",
      "At the mention of this gigantic sum we all stared at one another open-eyed.\n",
      "Miss Morstan, could we secure her rights, would change from a needy governess to the richest heiress in England.\n",
      "Surely it was the place of a loyal friend to rejoice at such news; yet I am ashamed to say that selfishness took me by the soul, and that my heart turned as heavy as lead within me. I stammered out some few halting words of congratulation, and then sat downcast, with my head drooped, deaf to the babble of our new acquaintance.\n",
      "He was clearly a confirmed hypochondriac, and I was dreamily conscious that he was pouring forth interminable trains of symptoms, and imploring information as to the composition and action of innumerable quack nostrums, some of which he bore about in a leather case in his pocket.\n",
      "I trust that he may not remember any of the answers which I gave him that night.\n",
      "Holmes declares that he overheard me caution him against the great danger of taking more than two drops of castor oil, while I recommended strychnine in large doses as a sedative.\n",
      "However that may be, I was certainly relieved when our cab pulled up with a jerk and the coachman sprang down to open the door.\n",
      "\"This, Miss Morstan, is Pondicherry Lodge,\" said Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, as he handed her out.\n",
      "CHAPTER V The Tragedy of Pondicherry Lodge\n",
      "It was nearly eleven o'clock when we reached this final stage of our night's adventures.\n",
      "We had left the damp fog of the great city behind us, and the night was fairly fine.\n",
      "A warm wind blew from the westward, and heavy clouds moved slowly across the sky, with half a moon peeping occasionally through the rifts.\n",
      "It was clear enough to see for some distance, but Thaddeus Sholto took down one of the side-lamps from the carriage to give us a better light upon our way.\n",
      "Pondicherry Lodge stood in its own grounds, and was girt round with a very high stone wall topped with broken glass.\n",
      "A single narrow iron-clamped door formed the only means of entrance.\n",
      "On this our guide knocked with a peculiar postman-like rat-tat.\n",
      "\"Who is there?\" cried a gruff voice from within.\n",
      "\"It is I, McMurdo. You surely know my knock by this time.\"\n",
      "There was a grumbling sound and a clanking and jarring of keys.\n",
      "The door swung heavily back, and a short, deep-chested man stood in the opening, with the yellow light of the lantern shining upon his protruded face and twinkling distrustful eyes.\n",
      "\"That you, Mr. Thaddeus? But who are the others? I had no orders about them from the master.\"\n",
      "\"No, McMurdo?\n",
      "You surprise me!\n",
      "I told my brother last night that I should bring some friends.\n",
      "\"He ain't been out o' his room to-day, Mr. Thaddeus, and I have no orders. You know very well that I must stick to regulations. I can let you in, but your friends must just stop where they are.\"\n",
      "This was an unexpected obstacle.\n",
      "Thaddeus Sholto looked about him in a perplexed and helpless manner.\n",
      "\"This is too bad of you, McMurdo!\" he said.\n",
      "\"If I guarantee them, that is enough for you. There is the young lady, too. She cannot wait on the public road at this hour.\"\n",
      "\"Very sorry, Mr. Thaddeus,\" said the porter, inexorably.\n",
      "\"Folk may be friends o' yours, and yet no friends o' the master's. He pays me well to do my duty, and my duty I'll do. I don't know none o' your friends.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, yes you do, McMurdo,\" cried Sherlock Holmes, genially.\n",
      "\"I don't think you can have forgotten me. Don't you remember the amateur who fought three rounds with you at Alison's rooms on the night of your benefit four years back?\"\n",
      "\"Not Mr. Sherlock Holmes!\" roared the prize-fighter.\n",
      "\"God's truth! how could I have mistook you? If instead o' standin' there so quiet you had just stepped up and given me that cross-hit of yours under the jaw, I'd ha' known you without a question. Ah, you're one that has wasted your gifts, you have! You might have aimed high, if you had joined the fancy.\"\n",
      "\"You see, Watson, if all else fails me I have still one of the scientific professions open to me,\" said Holmes, laughing.\n",
      "\"Our friend won't keep us out in the cold now, I am sure.\"\n",
      "\"In you come, sir, in you come,--you and your friends,\" he answered.\n",
      "\"Very sorry, Mr. Thaddeus, but orders are very strict. Had to be certain of your friends before I let them in.\"\n",
      "Inside, a gravel path wound through desolate grounds to a huge clump of a house, square and prosaic, all plunged in shadow save where a moonbeam struck one corner and glimmered in a garret window.\n",
      "The vast size of the building, with its gloom and its deathly silence, struck a chill to the heart.\n",
      "Even Thaddeus Sholto seemed ill at ease, and the lantern quivered and rattled in his hand.\n",
      "\"I cannot understand it,\" he said.\n",
      "\"There must be some mistake. I distinctly told Bartholomew that we should be here, and yet there is no light in his window. I do not know what to make of it.\"\n",
      "\"Does he always guard the premises in this way?\" asked Holmes.\n",
      "\"Yes; he has followed my father's custom. He was the favorite son, you know, and I sometimes think that my father may have told him more than he ever told me. That is Bartholomew's window up there where the moonshine strikes. It is quite bright, but there is no light from within, I think.\"\n",
      "\"None,\" said Holmes.\n",
      "\"But I see the glint of a light in that little window beside the door.\"\n",
      "\"Ah, that is the housekeeper's room. That is where old Mrs. Bernstone sits. She can tell us all about it. But perhaps you would not mind waiting here for a minute or two, for if we all go in together and she has no word of our coming she may be alarmed. But hush! what is that?\"\n",
      "He held up the lantern, and his hand shook until the circles of light flickered and wavered all round us.\n",
      "Miss Morstan seized my wrist, and we all stood with thumping hearts, straining our ears.\n",
      "From the great black house there sounded through the silent night the saddest and most pitiful of sounds,--the shrill, broken whimpering of a frightened woman.\n",
      "\"It is Mrs. Bernstone,\" said Sholto.\n",
      "\"She is the only woman in the house. Wait here. I shall be back in a moment.\"\n",
      "He hurried for the door, and knocked in his peculiar way.\n",
      "We could see a tall old woman admit him, and sway with pleasure at the very sight of him.\n",
      "\"Oh, Mr. Thaddeus, sir, I am so glad you have come! I am so glad you have come, Mr. Thaddeus, sir!\"\n",
      "We heard her reiterated rejoicings until the door was closed and her voice died away into a muffled monotone.\n",
      "Our guide had left us the lantern.\n",
      "Holmes swung it slowly round, and peered keenly at the house, and at the great rubbish-heaps which cumbered the grounds.\n",
      "Miss Morstan and I stood together, and her hand was in mine.\n",
      "A wondrous subtle thing is love, for here were we two who had never seen each other before that day, between whom no word or even look of affection had ever passed, and yet now in an hour of trouble our hands instinctively sought for each other.\n",
      "I have marvelled at it since, but at the time it seemed the most natural thing that I should go out to her so, and, as she has often told me, there was in her also the instinct to turn to me for comfort and protection.\n",
      "So we stood hand in hand, like two children, and there was peace in our hearts for all the dark things that surrounded us.\n",
      "\"What a strange place!\" she said, looking round.\n",
      "\"It looks as though all the moles in England had been let loose in it. I have seen something of the sort on the side of a hill near Ballarat, where the prospectors had been at work.\"\n",
      "\"And from the same cause,\" said Holmes.\n",
      "\"These are the traces of the treasure-seekers. You must remember that they were six years looking for it. No wonder that the grounds look like a gravel-pit.\"\n",
      "At that moment the door of the house burst open, and Thaddeus Sholto came running out, with his hands thrown forward and terror in his eyes.\n",
      "\"There is something amiss with Bartholomew!\" he cried.\n",
      "\"I am frightened! My nerves cannot stand it.\"\n",
      "He was, indeed, half blubbering with fear, and his twitching feeble face peeping out from the great Astrakhan collar had the helpless appealing expression of a terrified child.\n",
      "\"Come into the house,\" said Holmes, in his crisp, firm way.\n",
      "\"Yes, do!\" pleaded Thaddeus Sholto.\n",
      "\"I really do not feel equal to giving directions.\"\n",
      "We all followed him into the housekeeper's room, which stood upon the left-hand side of the passage.\n",
      "The old woman was pacing up and down with a scared look and restless picking fingers, but the sight of Miss Morstan appeared to have a soothing effect upon her.\n",
      "\"God bless your sweet calm face!\" she cried, with an hysterical sob.\n",
      "\"It does me good to see you. Oh, but I have been sorely tried this day!\"\n",
      "Our companion patted her thin, work-worn hand, and murmured some few words of kindly womanly comfort which brought the color back into the others bloodless cheeks.\n",
      "\"Master has locked himself in and will now answer me,\" she explained.\n",
      "\"All day I have waited to hear from him, for he often likes to be alone; but an hour ago I feared that something was amiss, so I went up and peeped through the key-hole. You must go up, Mr. Thaddeus,--you must go up and look for yourself. I have seen Mr. Bartholomew Sholto in joy and in sorrow for ten long years, but I never saw him with such a face on him as that.\"\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes took the lamp and led the way, for Thaddeus Sholto's teeth were chattering in his head.\n",
      "So shaken was he that I had to pass my hand under his arm as we went up the stairs, for his knees were trembling under him.\n",
      "Twice as we ascended Holmes whipped his lens out of his pocket and carefully examined marks which appeared to me to be mere shapeless smudges of dust upon the cocoa-nut matting which served as a stair-carpet.\n",
      "He walked slowly from step to step, holding the lamp, and shooting keen glances to right and left.\n",
      "Miss Morstan had remained behind with the frightened housekeeper.\n",
      "The third flight of stairs ended in a straight passage of some length, with a great picture in Indian tapestry upon the right of it and three doors upon the left.\n",
      "Holmes advanced along it in the same slow and methodical way, while we kept close at his heels, with our long black shadows streaming backwards down the corridor.\n",
      "The third door was that which we were seeking.\n",
      "Holmes knocked without receiving any answer, and then tried to turn the handle and force it open.\n",
      "It was locked on the inside, however, and by a broad and powerful bolt, as we could see when we set our lamp up against it.\n",
      "The key being turned, however, the hole was not entirely closed.\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes bent down to it, and instantly rose again with a sharp intaking of the breath.\n",
      "\"There is something devilish in this, Watson,\" said he, more moved than I had ever before seen him.\n",
      "\"What do you make of it?\"\n",
      "I stooped to the hole, and recoiled in horror.\n",
      "Moonlight was streaming into the room, and it was bright with a vague and shifty radiance.\n",
      "Looking straight at me, and suspended, as it were, in the air, for all beneath was in shadow, there hung a face,--the very face of our companion Thaddeus.\n",
      "There was the same high, shining head, the same circular bristle of red hair, the same bloodless countenance.\n",
      "The features were set, however, in a horrible smile, a fixed and unnatural grin, which in that still and moonlit room was more jarring to the nerves than any scowl or contortion.\n",
      "So like was the face to that of our little friend that I looked round at him to make sure that he was indeed with us.\n",
      "Then I recalled to mind that he had mentioned to us that his brother and he were twins.\n",
      "\"This is terrible!\"\n",
      "I said to Holmes.\n",
      "\"What is to be done?\"\n",
      "\"The door must come down,\" he answered, and, springing against it, he put all his weight upon the lock.\n",
      "It creaked and groaned, but did not yield.\n",
      "Together we flung ourselves upon it once more, and this time it gave way with a sudden snap, and we found ourselves within Bartholomew Sholto's chamber.\n",
      "It appeared to have been fitted up as a chemical laboratory.\n",
      "A double line of glass-stoppered bottles was drawn up upon the wall opposite the door, and the table was littered over with Bunsen burners, test-tubes, and retorts.\n",
      "In the corners stood carboys of acid in wicker baskets.\n",
      "One of these appeared to leak or to have been broken, for a stream of dark-colored liquid had trickled out from it, and the air was heavy with a peculiarly pungent, tar-like odor.\n",
      "A set of steps stood at one side of the room, in the midst of a litter of lath and plaster, and above them there was an opening in the ceiling large enough for a man to pass through.\n",
      "At the foot of the steps a long coil of rope was thrown carelessly together.\n",
      "By the table, in a wooden arm-chair, the master of the house was seated all in a heap, with his head sunk upon his left shoulder, and that ghastly, inscrutable smile upon his face.\n",
      "He was stiff and cold, and had clearly been dead many hours.\n",
      "It seemed to me that not only his features but all his limbs were twisted and turned in the most fantastic fashion.\n",
      "By his hand upon the table there lay a peculiar instrument,--a brown, close-grained stick, with a stone head like a hammer, rudely lashed on with coarse twine.\n",
      "Beside it was a torn sheet of note-paper with some words scrawled upon it.\n",
      "Holmes glanced at it, and then handed it to me.\n",
      "\"You see,\" he said, with a significant raising of the eyebrows.\n",
      "In the light of the lantern I read, with a thrill of horror, \"The sign of the four.\"\n",
      "\"In God's name, what does it all mean?\"\n",
      "I asked.\n",
      "\"It means murder,\" said he, stooping over the dead man.\n",
      "\"Ah, I expected it. Look here!\"\n",
      "He pointed to what looked like a long, dark thorn stuck in the skin just above the ear.\n",
      "\"It looks like a thorn,\" said I.\n",
      "\"It is a thorn. You may pick it out. But be careful, for it is poisoned.\"\n",
      "I took it up between my finger and thumb.\n",
      "It came away from the skin so readily that hardly any mark was left behind.\n",
      "One tiny speck of blood showed where the puncture had been.\n",
      "\"This is all an insoluble mystery to me,\" said I. \"It grows darker instead of clearer.\"\n",
      "\"On the contrary,\" he answered, \"it clears every instant. I only require a few missing links to have an entirely connected case.\"\n",
      "We had almost forgotten our companion's presence since we entered the chamber.\n",
      "He was still standing in the door-way, the very picture of terror, wringing his hands and moaning to himself.\n",
      "Suddenly, however, he broke out into a sharp, querulous cry.\n",
      "\"The treasure is gone!\" he said.\n",
      "\"They have robbed him of the treasure! There is the hole through which we lowered it. I helped him to do it! I was the last person who saw him! I left him here last night, and I heard him lock the door as I came down-stairs.\"\n",
      "\"What time was that?\"\n",
      "\"It was ten o'clock. And now he is dead, and the police will be called in, and I shall be suspected of having had a hand in it. Oh, yes, I am sure I shall. But you don't think so, gentlemen? Surely you don't think that it was I? Is it likely that I would have brought you here if it were I? Oh, dear! oh, dear! I know that I shall go mad!\"\n",
      "He jerked his arms and stamped his feet in a kind of convulsive frenzy.\n",
      "\"You have no reason for fear, Mr. Sholto,\" said Holmes, kindly, putting his hand upon his shoulder.\n",
      "\"Take my advice, and drive down to the station to report this matter to the police. Offer to assist them in every way. We shall wait here until your return.\"\n",
      "The little man obeyed in a half-stupefied fashion, and we heard him stumbling down the stairs in the dark.\n",
      "CHAPTER VI Sherlock Holmes Gives a Demonstration\n",
      "\"Now, Watson,\" said Holmes, rubbing his hands, \"we have half an hour to ourselves. Let us make good use of it. My case is, as I have told you, almost complete; but we must not err on the side of over-confidence. Simple as the case seems now, there may be something deeper underlying it.\"\n",
      "\"Simple!\"\n",
      "I ejaculated.\n",
      "\"Surely,\" said he, with something of the air of a clinical professor expounding to his class.\n",
      "\"Just sit in the corner there, that your footprints may not complicate matters. Now to work! In the first place, how did these folk come, and how did they go? The door has not been opened since last night. How of the window?\"\n",
      "He carried the lamp across to it, muttering his observations aloud the while, but addressing them to himself rather than to me.\n",
      "\"Window is snibbed on the inner side. Framework is solid. No hinges at the side. Let us open it. No water-pipe near. Roof quite out of reach. Yet a man has mounted by the window. It rained a little last night. Here is the print of a foot in mould upon the sill. And here is a circular muddy mark, and here again upon the floor, and here again by the table. See here, Watson! This is really a very pretty demonstration.\"\n",
      "I looked at the round, well-defined muddy discs.\n",
      "\"This is not a footmark,\" said I.\n",
      "\"It is something much more valuable to us. It is the impression of a wooden stump. You see here on the sill is the boot-mark, a heavy boot with the broad metal heel, and beside it is the mark of the timber-toe.\"\n",
      "\"It is the wooden-legged man.\"\n",
      "\"Quite so. But there has been some one else,--a very able and efficient ally. Could you scale that wall, doctor?\"\n",
      "I looked out of the open window.\n",
      "The moon still shone brightly on that angle of the house.\n",
      "We were a good sixty feet from the ground, and, look where I would, I could see no foothold, nor as much as a crevice in the brick-work.\n",
      "\"It is absolutely impossible,\" I answered.\n",
      "\"Without aid it is so. But suppose you had a friend up here who lowered you this good stout rope which I see in the corner, securing one end of it to this great hook in the wall. Then, I think, if you were an active man, you might swarm up, wooden leg and all. You would depart, of course, in the same fashion, and your ally would draw up the rope, untie it from the hook, shut the window, snib it on the inside, and get away in the way that he originally came. As a minor point it may be noted,\" he continued, fingering the rope, \"that our wooden-legged friend, though a fair climber, was not a professional sailor. His hands were far from horny. My lens discloses more than one blood-mark, especially towards the end of the rope, from which I gather that he slipped down with such velocity that he took the skin off his hand.\"\n",
      "\"This is all very well,\" said I, \"but the thing becomes more unintelligible than ever. How about this mysterious ally? How came he into the room?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, the ally!\" repeated Holmes, pensively.\n",
      "\"There are features of interest about this ally. He lifts the case from the regions of the commonplace. I fancy that this ally breaks fresh ground in the annals of crime in this country,--though parallel cases suggest themselves from India, and, if my memory serves me, from Senegambia.\"\n",
      "\"How came he, then?\"\n",
      "I reiterated.\n",
      "\"The door is locked, the window is inaccessible. Was it through the chimney?\"\n",
      "\"The grate is much too small,\" he answered.\n",
      "\"I had already considered that possibility.\"\n",
      "\"How then?\"\n",
      "I persisted.\n",
      "\"You will not apply my precept,\" he said, shaking his head.\n",
      "\"How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth? We know that he did not come through the door, the window, or the chimney. We also know that he could not have been concealed in the room, as there is no concealment possible. Whence, then, did he come?\"\n",
      "\"He came through the hole in the roof,\" I cried.\n",
      "\"Of course he did. He must have done so. If you will have the kindness to hold the lamp for me, we shall now extend our researches to the room above,--the secret room in which the treasure was found.\"\n",
      "He mounted the steps, and, seizing a rafter with either hand, he swung himself up into the garret.\n",
      "Then, lying on his face, he reached down for the lamp and held it while I followed him.\n",
      "The chamber in which we found ourselves was about ten feet one way and six the other.\n",
      "The floor was formed by the rafters, with thin lath-and-plaster between, so that in walking one had to step from beam to beam.\n",
      "The roof ran up to an apex, and was evidently the inner shell of the true roof of the house.\n",
      "There was no furniture of any sort, and the accumulated dust of years lay thick upon the floor.\n",
      "\"Here you are, you see,\" said Sherlock Holmes, putting his hand against the sloping wall.\n",
      "\"This is a trap-door which leads out on to the roof. I can press it back, and here is the roof itself, sloping at a gentle angle. This, then, is the way by which Number One entered. Let us see if we can find one other traces of his individuality.\"\n",
      "He held down the lamp to the floor, and as he did so I saw for the second time that night a startled, surprised look come over his face.\n",
      "For myself, as I followed his gaze my skin was cold under my clothes.\n",
      "The floor was covered thickly with the prints of a naked foot,--clear, well defined, perfectly formed, but scarce half the size of those of an ordinary man.\n",
      "\"Holmes,\" I said, in a whisper, \"a child has done the horrid thing.\"\n",
      "He had recovered his self-possession in an instant.\n",
      "\"I was staggered for the moment,\" he said, \"but the thing is quite natural. My memory failed me, or I should have been able to foretell it. There is nothing more to be learned here. Let us go down.\"\n",
      "\"What is your theory, then, as to those footmarks?\"\n",
      "I asked, eagerly, when we had regained the lower room once more.\n",
      "\"My dear Watson, try a little analysis yourself,\" said he, with a touch of impatience.\n",
      "\"You know my methods. Apply them, and it will be instructive to compare results.\"\n",
      "\"I cannot conceive anything which will cover the facts,\" I answered.\n",
      "\"It will be clear enough to you soon,\" he said, in an off-hand way.\n",
      "\"I think that there is nothing else of importance here, but I will look.\"\n",
      "He whipped out his lens and a tape measure, and hurried about the room on his knees, measuring, comparing, examining, with his long thin nose only a few inches from the planks, and his beady eyes gleaming and deep-set like those of a bird.\n",
      "So swift, silent, and furtive were his movements, like those of a trained blood-hound picking out a scent, that I could not but think what a terrible criminal he would have made had he turned his energy and sagacity against the law, instead of exerting them in its defense.\n",
      "As he hunted about, he kept muttering to himself, and finally he broke out into a loud crow of delight.\n",
      "\"We are certainly in luck,\" said he.\n",
      "\"We ought to have very little trouble now. Number One has had the misfortune to tread in the creosote. You can see the outline of the edge of his small foot here at the side of this evil-smelling mess. The carboy has been cracked, You see, and the stuff has leaked out.\"\n",
      "\"What then?\"\n",
      "I asked.\n",
      "\"Why, we have got him, that's all,\" said he.\n",
      "\"I know a dog that would follow that scent to the world's end. If a pack can track a trailed herring across a shire, how far can a specially-trained hound follow so pungent a smell as this? It sounds like a sum in the rule of three. The answer should give us the--But halloo! here are the accredited representatives of the law.\"\n",
      "Heavy steps and the clamor of loud voices were audible from below, and the hall door shut with a loud crash.\n",
      "\"Before they come,\" said Holmes, \"just put your hand here on this poor fellow's arm, and here on his leg. What do you feel?\"\n",
      "\"The muscles are as hard as a board,\" I answered.\n",
      "\"Quite so. They are in a state of extreme contraction, far exceeding the usual rigor mortis. Coupled with this distortion of the face, this Hippocratic smile, or 'risus sardonicus,' as the old writers called it, what conclusion would it suggest to your mind?\"\n",
      "\"Death from some powerful vegetable alkaloid,\" I answered,--\"some strychnine-like substance which would produce tetanus.\"\n",
      "\"That was the idea which occurred to me the instant I saw the drawn muscles of the face. On getting into the room I at once looked for the means by which the poison had entered the system. As you saw, I discovered a thorn which had been driven or shot with no great force into the scalp. You observe that the part struck was that which would be turned towards the hole in the ceiling if the man were erect in his chair. Now examine the thorn.\"\n",
      "I took it up gingerly and held it in the light of the lantern.\n",
      "It was long, sharp, and black, with a glazed look near the point as though some gummy substance had dried upon it.\n",
      "The blunt end had been trimmed and rounded off with a knife.\n",
      "\"Is that an English thorn?\" he asked.\n",
      "\"No, it certainly is not.\"\n",
      "\"With all these data you should be able to draw some just inference. But here are the regulars: so the auxiliary forces may beat a retreat.\"\n",
      "As he spoke, the steps which had been coming nearer sounded loudly on the passage, and a very stout, portly man in a gray suit strode heavily into the room.\n",
      "He was red-faced, burly and plethoric, with a pair of very small twinkling eyes which looked keenly out from between swollen and puffy pouches.\n",
      "He was closely followed by an inspector in uniform, and by the still palpitating Thaddeus Sholto.\n",
      "\"Here's a business!\" he cried, in a muffled, husky voice.\n",
      "\"Here's a pretty business! But who are all these? Why, the house seems to be as full as a rabbit-warren!\"\n",
      "\"I think you must recollect me, Mr. Athelney Jones,\" said Holmes, quietly.\n",
      "\"Why, of course I do!\" he wheezed.\n",
      "\"It's Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the theorist. Remember you! I'll never forget how you lectured us all on causes and inferences and effects in the Bishopgate jewel case. It's true you set us on the right track; but you'll own now that it was more by good luck than good guidance.\"\n",
      "\"It was a piece of very simple reasoning.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, come, now, come! Never be ashamed to own up. But what is all this? Bad business! Bad business! Stern facts here,--no room for theories. How lucky that I happened to be out at Norwood over another case! I was at the station when the message arrived. What d'you think the man died of?\"\n",
      "\"Oh, this is hardly a case for me to theorize over,\" said Holmes, dryly.\n",
      "\"No, no. Still, we can't deny that you hit the nail on the head sometimes. Dear me! Door locked, I understand. Jewels worth half a million missing. How was the window?\"\n",
      "\"Fastened; but there are steps on the sill.\"\n",
      "\"Well, well, if it was fastened the steps could have nothing to do with the matter. That's common sense. Man might have died in a fit; but then the jewels are missing. Ha! I have a theory. These flashes come upon me at times.--Just step outside, sergeant, and you, Mr. Sholto. Your friend can remain.--What do you think of this, Holmes? Sholto was, on his own confession, with his brother last night. The brother died in a fit, on which Sholto walked off with the treasure. How's that?\"\n",
      "\"On which the dead man very considerately got up and locked the door on the inside.\"\n",
      "\"Hum! There's a flaw there. Let us apply common sense to the matter. This Thaddeus Sholto was with his brother; there was a quarrel; so much we know. The brother is dead and the jewels are gone. So much also we know. No one saw the brother from the time Thaddeus left him. His bed had not been slept in. Thaddeus is evidently in a most disturbed state of mind. His appearance is--well, not attractive. You see that I am weaving my web round Thaddeus. The net begins to close upon him.\"\n",
      "\"You are not quite in possession of the facts yet,\" said Holmes.\n",
      "\"This splinter of wood, which I have every reason to believe to be poisoned, was in the man's scalp where you still see the mark; this card, inscribed as you see it, was on the table; and beside it lay this rather curious stone-headed instrument. How does all that fit into your theory?\"\n",
      "\"Confirms it in every respect,\" said the fat detective, pompously.\n",
      "\"House is full of Indian curiosities. Thaddeus brought this up, and if this splinter be poisonous Thaddeus may as well have made murderous use of it as any other man. The card is some hocus-pocus,--a blind, as like as not. The only question is, how did he depart? Ah, of course, here is a hole in the roof.\"\n",
      "With great activity, considering his bulk, he sprang up the steps and squeezed through into the garret, and immediately afterwards we heard his exulting voice proclaiming that he had found the trap-door.\n",
      "\"He can find something,\" remarked Holmes, shrugging his shoulders.\n",
      "\"He has occasional glimmerings of reason. Il n'y a pas des sots si incommodes que ceux qui ont de l'esprit!\"\n",
      "\"You see!\" said Athelney Jones, reappearing down the steps again.\n",
      "\"Facts are better than mere theories, after all. My view of the case is confirmed. There is a trap-door communicating with the roof, and it is partly open.\"\n",
      "\"It was I who opened it.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, indeed! You did notice it, then?\"\n",
      "He seemed a little crestfallen at the discovery.\n",
      "\"Well, whoever noticed it, it shows how our gentleman got away. Inspector!\"\n",
      "\"Yes, sir,\" from the passage.\n",
      "\"Ask Mr. Sholto to step this way.--Mr. Sholto, it is my duty to inform you that anything which you may say will be used against you. I arrest you in the Queen's name as being concerned in the death of your brother.\"\n",
      "\"There, now! Didn't I tell you!\" cried the poor little man, throwing out his hands, and looking from one to the other of us.\n",
      "\"Don't trouble yourself about it, Mr. Sholto,\" said Holmes.\n",
      "\"I think that I can engage to clear you of the charge.\"\n",
      "\"Don't promise too much, Mr. Theorist,--don't promise too much!\" snapped the detective.\n",
      "\"You may find it a harder matter than you think.\"\n",
      "\"Not only will I clear him, Mr. Jones, but I will make you a free present of the name and description of one of the two people who were in this room last night. His name, I have every reason to believe, is Jonathan Small. He is a poorly-educated man, small, active, with his right leg off, and wearing a wooden stump which is worn away upon the inner side. His left boot has a coarse, square-toed sole, with an iron band round the heel. He is a middle-aged man, much sunburned, and has been a convict. These few indications may be of some assistance to you, coupled with the fact that there is a good deal of skin missing from the palm of his hand. The other man--\"\n",
      "\"Ah! the other man--?\" asked Athelney Jones, in a sneering voice, but impressed none the less, as I could easily see, by the precision of the other's manner.\n",
      "\"Is a rather curious person,\" said Sherlock Holmes, turning upon his heel.\n",
      "\"I hope before very long to be able to introduce you to the pair of them. A word with you, Watson.\"\n",
      "He led me out to the head of the stair.\n",
      "\"This unexpected occurrence,\" he said, \"has caused us rather to lose sight of the original purpose of our journey.\"\n",
      "\"I have just been thinking so,\" I answered.\n",
      "\"It is not right that Miss Morstan should remain in this stricken house.\"\n",
      "\"No. You must escort her home. She lives with Mrs. Cecil Forrester, in Lower Camberwell: so it is not very far. I will wait for you here if you will drive out again. Or perhaps you are too tired?\"\n",
      "\"By no means. I don't think I could rest until I know more of this fantastic business. I have seen something of the rough side of life, but I give you my word that this quick succession of strange surprises to-night has shaken my nerve completely. I should like, however, to see the matter through with you, now that I have got so far.\"\n",
      "\"Your presence will be of great service to me,\" he answered.\n",
      "\"We shall work the case out independently, and leave this fellow Jones to exult over any mare's-nest which he may choose to construct. When you have dropped Miss Morstan I wish you to go on to No. 3 Pinchin Lane, down near the water's edge at Lambeth. The third house on the right-hand side is a bird-stuffer's: Sherman is the name. You will see a weasel holding a young rabbit in the window. Knock old Sherman up, and tell him, with my compliments, that I want Toby at once. You will bring Toby back in the cab with you.\"\n",
      "\"A dog, I suppose.\"\n",
      "\"Yes,--a queer mongrel, with a most amazing power of scent. I would rather have Toby's help than that of the whole detective force of London.\"\n",
      "\"I shall bring him, then,\" said I. \"It is one now. I ought to be back before three, if I can get a fresh horse.\"\n",
      "\"And I,\" said Holmes, \"shall see what I can learn from Mrs. Bernstone, and from the Indian servant, who, Mr. Thaddeus tell me, sleeps in the next garret. Then I shall study the great Jones's methods and listen to his not too delicate sarcasms. 'Wir sind gewohnt, daß die Menschen verhöhnen was sie nicht verstehen.' Goethe is always pithy.\"\n",
      "CHAPTER VII The Episode of the Barrel\n",
      "The police had brought a cab with them, and in this I escorted Miss Morstan back to her home.\n",
      "After the angelic fashion of women, she had borne trouble with a calm face as long as there was some one weaker than herself to support, and I had found her bright and placid by the side of the frightened housekeeper.\n",
      "In the cab, however, she first turned faint, and then burst into a passion of weeping,--so sorely had she been tried by the adventures of the night.\n",
      "She has told me since that she thought me cold and distant upon that journey.\n",
      "She little guessed the struggle within my breast, or the effort of self-restraint which held me back.\n",
      "My sympathies and my love went out to her, even as my hand had in the garden.\n",
      "I felt that years of the conventionalities of life could not teach me to know her sweet, brave nature as had this one day of strange experiences.\n",
      "Yet there were two thoughts which sealed the words of affection upon my lips.\n",
      "She was weak and helpless, shaken in mind and nerve.\n",
      "It was to take her at a disadvantage to obtrude love upon her at such a time.\n",
      "Worse still, she was rich.\n",
      "If Holmes's researches were successful, she would be an heiress.\n",
      "Was it fair, was it honorable, that a half-pay surgeon should take such advantage of an intimacy which chance had brought about?\n",
      "Might she not look upon me as a mere vulgar fortune-seeker?\n",
      "I could not bear to risk that such a thought should cross her mind.\n",
      "This Agra treasure intervened like an impassable barrier between us.\n",
      "It was nearly two o'clock when we reached Mrs. Cecil Forrester's.\n",
      "The servants had retired hours ago, but Mrs. Forrester had been so interested by the strange message which Miss Morstan had received that she had sat up in the hope of her return.\n",
      "She opened the door herself, a middle-aged, graceful woman, and it gave me joy to see how tenderly her arm stole round the other's waist and how motherly was the voice in which she greeted her.\n",
      "She was clearly no mere paid dependant, but an honored friend.\n",
      "I was introduced, and Mrs. Forrester earnestly begged me to step in and tell her our adventures.\n",
      "I explained, however, the importance of my errand, and promised faithfully to call and report any progress which we might make with the case.\n",
      "As we drove away I stole a glance back, and I still seem to see that little group on the step, the two graceful, clinging figures, the half-opened door, the hall light shining through stained glass, the barometer, and the bright stair-rods.\n",
      "It was soothing to catch even that passing glimpse of a tranquil English home in the midst of the wild, dark business which had absorbed us.\n",
      "And the more I thought of what had happened, the wilder and darker it grew.\n",
      "I reviewed the whole extraordinary sequence of events as I rattled on through the silent gas-lit streets.\n",
      "There was the original problem: that at least was pretty clear now.\n",
      "The death of Captain Morstan, the sending of the pearls, the advertisement, the letter,--we had had light upon all those events. They had only led us, however, to a deeper and far more tragic mystery. The Indian treasure, the curious plan found among Morstan's baggage, the strange scene at Major Sholto's death, the rediscovery of the treasure immediately followed by the murder of the discoverer, the very singular accompaniments to the crime, the footsteps, the remarkable weapons, the words upon the card, corresponding with those upon Captain Morstan's chart,--here was indeed a labyrinth in which a man less singularly endowed than my fellow-lodger might well despair of ever finding the clue.\n",
      "Pinchin Lane was a row of shabby two-storied brick houses in the lower quarter of Lambeth.\n",
      "I had to knock for some time at No. 3 before I could make my impression.\n",
      "At last, however, there was the glint of a candle behind the blind, and a face looked out at the upper window.\n",
      "\"Go on, you drunken vagabone,\" said the face.\n",
      "\"If you kick up any more row I'll open the kennels and let out forty-three dogs upon you.\"\n",
      "\"If you'll let one out it's just what I have come for,\" said I.\n",
      "\"Go on!\" yelled the voice.\n",
      "\"So help me gracious, I have a wiper in the bag, an' I'll drop it on your 'ead if you don't hook it.\"\n",
      "\"But I want a dog,\" I cried.\n",
      "\"I won't be argued with!\" shouted Mr. Sherman.\n",
      "\"Now stand clear, for when I say 'three,' down goes the wiper.\"\n",
      "\"Mr. Sherlock Holmes--\"\n",
      "I began, but the words had a most magical effect, for the window instantly slammed down, and within a minute the door was unbarred and open.\n",
      "Mr. Sherman was a lanky, lean old man, with stooping shoulders, a stringy neck, and blue-tinted glasses.\n",
      "\"A friend of Mr. Sherlock is always welcome,\" said he.\n",
      "\"Step in, sir. Keep clear of the badger; for he bites. Ah, naughty, naughty, would you take a nip at the gentleman?\"\n",
      "This to a stoat which thrust its wicked head and red eyes between the bars of its cage.\n",
      "\"Don't mind that, sir: it's only a slow-worm. It hain't got no fangs, so I gives it the run o' the room, for it keeps the bettles down. You must not mind my bein' just a little short wi' you at first, for I'm guyed at by the children, and there's many a one just comes down this lane to knock me up. What was it that Mr. Sherlock Holmes wanted, sir?\"\n",
      "\"He wanted a dog of yours.\"\n",
      "\"Ah! that would be Toby.\"\n",
      "\"Yes, Toby was the name.\"\n",
      "\"Toby lives at No. 7 on the left here.\"\n",
      "He moved slowly forward with his candle among the queer animal family which he had gathered round him.\n",
      "In the uncertain, shadowy light I could see dimly that there were glancing, glimmering eyes peeping down at us from every cranny and corner.\n",
      "Even the rafters above our heads were lined by solemn fowls, who lazily shifted their weight from one leg to the other as our voices disturbed their slumbers.\n",
      "Toby proved to an ugly, long-haired, lop-eared creature, half spaniel and half lurcher, brown-and-white in color, with a very clumsy waddling gait.\n",
      "It accepted after some hesitation a lump of sugar which the old naturalist handed to me, and, having thus sealed an alliance, it followed me to the cab, and made no difficulties about accompanying me.\n",
      "It had just struck three on the Palace clock when I found myself back once more at Pondicherry Lodge.\n",
      "The ex-prize-fighter McMurdo had, I found, been arrested as an accessory, and both he and Mr. Sholto had been marched off to the station.\n",
      "Two constables guarded the narrow gate, but they allowed me to pass with the dog on my mentioning the detective's name.\n",
      "Holmes was standing on the door-step, with his hands in his pockets, smoking his pipe.\n",
      "\"Ah, you have him there!\" said he.\n",
      "\"Good dog, then! Athelney Jones has gone. We have had an immense display of energy since you left. He has arrested not only friend Thaddeus, but the gatekeeper, the housekeeper, and the Indian servant. We have the place to ourselves, but for a sergeant up-stairs. Leave the dog here, and come up.\"\n",
      "We tied Toby to the hall table, and reascended the stairs.\n",
      "The room was as we had left it, save that a sheet had been draped over the central figure.\n",
      "A weary-looking police-sergeant reclined in the corner.\n",
      "\"Lend me your bull's-eye, sergeant,\" said my companion.\n",
      "\"Now tie this bit of card round my neck, so as to hang it in front of me. Thank you. Now I must kick off my boots and stockings.--Just you carry them down with you, Watson. I am going to do a little climbing. And dip my handkerchief into the creasote. That will do. Now come up into the garret with me for a moment.\"\n",
      "We clambered up through the hole.\n",
      "Holmes turned his light once more upon the footsteps in the dust.\n",
      "\"I wish you particularly to notice these footmarks,\" he said.\n",
      "\"Do you observe anything noteworthy about them?\"\n",
      "\"They belong,\" I said, \"to a child or a small woman.\"\n",
      "\"Apart from their size, though. Is there nothing else?\"\n",
      "\"They appear to be much as other footmarks.\"\n",
      "\"Not at all. Look here! This is the print of a right foot in the dust. Now I make one with my naked foot beside it. What is the chief difference?\"\n",
      "\"Your toes are all cramped together. The other print has each toe distinctly divided.\"\n",
      "\"Quite so. That is the point. Bear that in mind. Now, would you kindly step over to that flap-window and smell the edge of the wood-work? I shall stay here, as I have this handkerchief in my hand.\"\n",
      "I did as he directed, and was instantly conscious of a strong tarry smell.\n",
      "\"That is where he put his foot in getting out. If you can trace him, I should think that Toby will have no difficulty. Now run down-stairs, loose the dog, and look out for Blondin.\"\n",
      "By the time that I got out into the grounds Sherlock Holmes was on the roof, and I could see him like an enormous glow-worm crawling very slowly along the ridge.\n",
      "I lost sight of him behind a stack of chimneys, but he presently reappeared, and then vanished once more upon the opposite side.\n",
      "When I made my way round there I found him seated at one of the corner eaves.\n",
      "\"That You, Watson?\" he cried.\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\"This is the place. What is that black thing down there?\"\n",
      "\"A water-barrel.\"\n",
      "\"Top on it?\"\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\"No sign of a ladder?\"\n",
      "\"No.\"\n",
      "\"Confound the fellow! It's a most break-neck place. I ought to be able to come down where he could climb up. The water-pipe feels pretty firm. Here goes, anyhow.\"\n",
      "There was a scuffling of feet, and the lantern began to come steadily down the side of the wall.\n",
      "Then with a light spring he came on to the barrel, and from there to the earth.\n",
      "\"It was easy to follow him,\" he said, drawing on his stockings and boots.\n",
      "\"Tiles were loosened the whole way along, and in his hurry he had dropped this. It confirms my diagnosis, as you doctors express it.\"\n",
      "The object which he held up to me was a small pocket or pouch woven out of colored grasses and with a few tawdry beads strung round it.\n",
      "In shape and size it was not unlike a cigarette-case.\n",
      "Inside were half a dozen spines of dark wood, sharp at one end and rounded at the other, like that which had struck Bartholomew Sholto.\n",
      "\"They are hellish things,\" said he.\n",
      "\"Look out that you don't prick yourself. I'm delighted to have them, for the chances are that they are all he has. There is the less fear of you or me finding one in our skin before long. I would sooner face a Martini bullet, myself. Are you game for a six-mile trudge, Watson?\"\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" I answered.\n",
      "\"Your leg will stand it?\"\n",
      "\"Oh, yes.\"\n",
      "\"Here you are, doggy! Good old Toby! Smell it, Toby, smell it!\"\n",
      "He pushed the creasote handkerchief under the dog's nose, while the creature stood with its fluffy legs separated, and with a most comical cock to its head, like a connoisseur sniffing the bouquet of a famous vintage.\n",
      "Holmes then threw the handkerchief to a distance, fastened a stout cord to the mongrel's collar, and let him to the foot of the water-barrel.\n",
      "The creature instantly broke into a succession of high, tremulous yelps, and, with his nose on the ground, and his tail in the air, pattered off upon the trail at a pace which strained his leash and kept us at the top of our speed.\n",
      "The east had been gradually whitening, and we could now see some distance in the cold gray light.\n",
      "The square, massive house, with its black, empty windows and high, bare walls, towered up, sad and forlorn, behind us.\n",
      "Our course let right across the grounds, in and out among the trenches and pits with which they were scarred and intersected.\n",
      "The whole place, with its scattered dirt-heaps and ill-grown shrubs, had a blighted, ill-omened look which harmonized with the black tragedy which hung over it.\n",
      "On reaching the boundary wall Toby ran along, whining eagerly, underneath its shadow, and stopped finally in a corner screened by a young beech.\n",
      "Where the two walls joined, several bricks had been loosened, and the crevices left were worn down and rounded upon the lower side, as though they had frequently been used as a ladder.\n",
      "Holmes clambered up, and, taking the dog from me, he dropped it over upon the other side.\n",
      "\"There's the print of wooden-leg's hand,\" he remarked, as I mounted up beside him.\n",
      "\"You see the slight smudge of blood upon the white plaster. What a lucky thing it is that we have had no very heavy rain since yesterday! The scent will lie upon the road in spite of their eight-and-twenty hours' start.\"\n",
      "I confess that I had my doubts myself when I reflected upon the great traffic which had passed along the London road in the interval.\n",
      "My fears were soon appeased, however.\n",
      "Toby never hesitated or swerved, but waddled on in his peculiar rolling fashion.\n",
      "Clearly, the pungent smell of the creasote rose high above all other contending scents.\n",
      "\"Do not imagine,\" said Holmes, \"that I depend for my success in this case upon the mere chance of one of these fellows having put his foot in the chemical. I have knowledge now which would enable me to trace them in many different ways. This, however, is the readiest and, since fortune has put it into our hands, I should be culpable if I neglected it. It has, however, prevented the case from becoming the pretty little intellectual problem which it at one time promised to be. There might have been some credit to be gained out of it, but for this too palpable clue.\"\n",
      "\"There is credit, and to spare,\" said I. \"I assure you, Holmes, that I marvel at the means by which you obtain your results in this case, even more than I did in the Jefferson Hope Murder. The thing seems to me to be deeper and more inexplicable. How, for example, could you describe with such confidence the wooden-legged man?\"\n",
      "\"Pshaw, my dear boy! it was simplicity itself. I don't wish to be theatrical. It is all patent and above-board. Two officers who are in command of a convict-guard learn an important secret as to buried treasure. A map is drawn for them by an Englishman named Jonathan Small. You remember that we saw the name upon the chart in Captain Morstan's possession. He had signed it in behalf of himself and his associates,--the sign of the four, as he somewhat dramatically called it. Aided by this chart, the officers--or one of them--gets the treasure and brings it to England, leaving, we will suppose, some condition under which he received it unfulfilled. Now, then, why did not Jonathan Small get the treasure himself? The answer is obvious. The chart is dated at a time when Morstan was brought into close association with convicts. Jonathan Small did not get the treasure because he and his associates were themselves convicts and could not get away.\"\n",
      "\"But that is mere speculation,\" said I.\n",
      "\"It is more than that. It is the only hypothesis which covers the facts. Let us see how it fits in with the sequel. Major Sholto remains at peace for some years, happy in the possession of his treasure. Then he receives a letter from India which gives him a great fright. What was that?\"\n",
      "\"A letter to say that the men whom he had wronged had been set free.\"\n",
      "\"Or had escaped. That is much more likely, for he would have known what their term of imprisonment was. It would not have been a surprise to him. What does he do then? He guards himself against a wooden-legged man,--a white man, mark you, for he mistakes a white tradesman for him, and actually fires a pistol at him. Now, only one white man's name is on the chart. The others are Hindoos or Mohammedans. There is no other white man. Therefore we may say with confidence that the wooden-legged man is identical with Jonathan Small. Does the reasoning strike yo as being faulty?\"\n",
      "\"No: it is clear and concise.\"\n",
      "\"Well, now, let us put ourselves in the place of Jonathan Small. Let us look at it from his point of view. He comes to England with the double idea of regaining what he would consider to be his rights and of having his revenge upon the man who had wronged him. He found out where Sholto lived, and very possibly he established communications with some one inside the house. There is this butler, Lal Rao, whom we have not seen. Mrs. Bernstone gives him far from a good character. Small could not find out, however, where the treasure was hid, for no one ever knew, save the major and one faithful servant who had died. Suddenly Small learns that the major is on his death-bed. In a frenzy lest the secret of the treasure die with him, he runs the gauntlet of the guards, makes his way to the dying man's window, and is only deterred from entering by the presence of his two sons. Mad with hate, however, against the dead man, he enters the room that night, searches his private papers in the hope of discovering some memorandum relating to the treasure, and finally leaves a memento of his visit in the short inscription upon the card. He had doubtless planned beforehand that should he slay the major he would leave some such record upon the body as a sign that it was not a common murder, but, from the point of view of the four associates, something in the nature of an act of justice. Whimsical and bizarre conceits of this kind are common enough in the annals of crime, and usually afford valuable indications as to the criminal. Do you follow all this?\"\n",
      "\"Very clearly.\"\n",
      "\"Now, what could Jonathan Small do? He could only continue to keep a secret watch upon the efforts made to find the treasure. Possibly he leaves England and only comes back at intervals. Then comes the discovery of the garret, and he is instantly informed of it. We again trace the presence of some confederate in the household. Jonathan, with his wooden leg, is utterly unable to reach the lofty room of Bartholomew Sholto. He takes with him, however, a rather curious associate, who gets over this difficulty, but dips his naked foot into creasote, whence come Toby, and a six-mile limp for a half-pay officer with a damaged tendo Achillis.\"\n",
      "\"But it was the associate, and not Jonathan, who committed the crime.\"\n",
      "\"Quite so. And rather to Jonathan's disgust, to judge by the way the stamped about when he got into the room. He bore no grudge against Bartholomew Sholto, and would have preferred if he could have been simply bound and gagged. He did not wish to put his head in a halter. There was no help for it, however: the savage instincts of his companion had broken out, and the poison had done its work: so Jonathan Small left his record, lowered the treasure-box to the ground, and followed it himself. That was the train of events as far as I can decipher them. Of course as to his personal appearance he must be middle-aged, and must be sunburned after serving his time in such an oven as the Andamans. His height is readily calculated from the length of his stride, and we know that he was bearded. His hairiness was the one point which impressed itself upon Thaddeus Sholto when he saw him at the window. I don't know that there is anything else.\"\n",
      "\"The associate?\"\n",
      "\"Ah, well, there is no great mystery in that. But you will know all about it soon enough. How sweet the morning air is! See how that one little cloud floats like a pink feather from some gigantic flamingo. Now the red rim of the sun pushes itself over the London cloud-bank. It shines on a good many folk, but on none, I dare bet, who are on a stranger errand than you and I. How small we feel with our petty ambitions and strivings in the presence of the great elemental forces of nature! Are you well up in your Jean Paul?\"\n",
      "\"Fairly so. I worked back to him through Carlyle.\"\n",
      "\"That was like following the brook to the parent lake. He makes one curious but profound remark. It is that the chief proof of man's real greatness lies in his perception of his own smallness. It argues, you see, a power of comparison and of appreciation which is in itself a proof of nobility. There is much food for thought in Richter. You have not a pistol, have you?\"\n",
      "\"I have my stick.\"\n",
      "\"It is just possible that we may need something of the sort if we get to their lair. Jonathan I shall leave to you, but if the other turns nasty I shall shoot him dead.\"\n",
      "He took out his revolver as he spoke, and, having loaded two of the chambers, he put it back into the right-hand pocket of his jacket.\n",
      "We had during this time been following the guidance of Toby down the half-rural villa-lined roads which lead to the metropolis.\n",
      "Now, however, we were beginning to come among continuous streets, where laborers and dockmen were already astir, and slatternly women were taking down shutters and brushing door-steps.\n",
      "At the square-topped corner public houses business was just beginning, and rough-looking men were emerging, rubbing their sleeves across their beards after their morning wet.\n",
      "Strange dogs sauntered up and stared wonderingly at us as we passed, but our inimitable Toby looked neither to the right nor to the left, but trotted onwards with his nose to the ground and an occasional eager whine which spoke of a hot scent.\n",
      "We had traversed Streatham, Brixton, Camberwell, and now found ourselves in Kennington Lane, having borne away through the side-streets to the east of the Oval.\n",
      "The men whom we pursued seemed to have taken a curiously zigzag road, with the idea probably of escaping observation.\n",
      "They had never kept to the main road if a parallel side-street would serve their turn.\n",
      "At the foot of Kennington Lane they had edged away to the left through Bond Street and Miles Street.\n",
      "Where the latter street turns into Knight's Place, Toby ceased to advance, but began to run backwards and forwards with one ear cocked and the other drooping, the very picture of canine indecision.\n",
      "Then he waddled round in circles, looking up to us from time to time, as if to ask for sympathy in his embarrassment.\n",
      "\"What the deuce is the matter with the dog?\" growled Holmes.\n",
      "\"They surely would not take a cab, or go off in a balloon.\"\n",
      "\"Perhaps they stood here for some time,\" I suggested.\n",
      "\"Ah! it's all right. He's off again,\" said my companion, in a tone of relief.\n",
      "He was indeed off, for after sniffing round again he suddenly made up his mind, and darted away with an energy and determination such as he had not yet shown.\n",
      "The scent appeared to be much hotter than before, for he had not even to put his nose on the ground, but tugged at his leash and tried to break into a run.\n",
      "I cold see by the gleam in Holmes's eyes that he thought we were nearing the end of our journey.\n",
      "Our course now ran down Nine Elms until we came to Broderick and Nelson's large timber-yard, just past the White Eagle tavern.\n",
      "Here the dog, frantic with excitement, turned down through the side-gate into the enclosure, where the sawyers were already at work.\n",
      "On the dog raced through sawdust and shavings, down an alley, round a passage, between two wood-piles, and finally, with a triumphant yelp, sprang upon a large barrel which still stood upon the hand-trolley on which it had been brought.\n",
      "With lolling tongue and blinking eyes, Toby stood upon the cask, looking from one to the other of us for some sign of appreciation.\n",
      "The staves of the barrel and the wheels of the trolley were smeared with a dark liquid, and the whole air was heavy with the smell of creasote.\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes and I looked blankly at each other, and then burst simultaneously into an uncontrollable fit of laughter.\n",
      "CHAPTER VIII The Baker Street Irregulars\n",
      "\"What now?\"\n",
      "I asked.\n",
      "\"Toby has lost his character for infallibility.\"\n",
      "\"He acted according to his lights,\" said Holmes, lifting him down from the barrel and walking him out of the timber-yard.\n",
      "\"If you consider how much creasote is carted about London in one day, it is no great wonder that our trail should have been crossed. It is much used now, especially for the seasoning of wood. Poor Toby is not to blame.\"\n",
      "\"We must get on the main scent again, I suppose.\"\n",
      "\"Yes. And, fortunately, we have no distance to go. Evidently what puzzled the dog at the corner of Knight's Place was that there were two different trails running in opposite directions. We took the wrong one. It only remains to follow the other.\"\n",
      "There was no difficulty about this.\n",
      "On leading Toby to the place where he had committed his fault, he cast about in a wide circle and finally dashed off in a fresh direction.\n",
      "\"We must take care that he does not now bring us to the place where the creasote-barrel came from,\" I observed.\n",
      "\"I had thought of that. But you notice that he keeps on the pavement, whereas the barrel passed down the roadway. No, we are on the true scent now.\"\n",
      "It tended down towards the river-side, running through Belmont Place and Prince's Street.\n",
      "At the end of Broad Street it ran right down to the water's edge, where there was a small wooden wharf.\n",
      "Toby led us to the very edge of this, and there stood whining, looking out on the dark current beyond.\n",
      "\"We are out of luck,\" said Holmes.\n",
      "\"They have taken to a boat here.\"\n",
      "Several small punts and skiffs were lying about in the water and on the edge of the wharf.\n",
      "We took Toby round to each in turn, but, though he sniffed earnestly, he made no sign.\n",
      "Close to the rude landing-stage was a small brick house, with a wooden placard slung out through the second window.\n",
      "\"Mordecai Smith\" was printed across it in large letters, and, underneath, \"Boats to hire by the hour or day.\"\n",
      "A second inscription above the door informed us that a steam launch was kept,--a statement which was confirmed by a great pile of coke upon the jetty.\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes looked slowly round, and his face assumed an ominous expression.\n",
      "\"This looks bad,\" said he.\n",
      "\"These fellows are sharper than I expected. They seem to have covered their tracks. There has, I fear, been preconcerted management here.\"\n",
      "He was approaching the door of the house, when it opened, and a little, curly-headed lad of six came running out, followed by a stoutish, red-faced woman with a large sponge in her hand.\n",
      "\"You come back and be washed, Jack,\" she shouted.\n",
      "\"Come back, you young imp; for if your father comes home and finds you like that, he'll let us hear of it.\"\n",
      "\"Dear little chap!\" said Holmes, strategically.\n",
      "\"What a rosy-cheeked young rascal! Now, Jack, is there anything you would like?\"\n",
      "The youth pondered for a moment.\n",
      "\"I'd like a shillin',\" said he.\n",
      "\"Nothing you would like better?\"\n",
      "\"I'd like two shillin' better,\" the prodigy answered, after some thought.\n",
      "\"Here you are, then! Catch!--A fine child, Mrs. Smith!\"\n",
      "\"Lor' bless you, sir, he is that, and forward. He gets a'most too much for me to manage, 'specially when my man is away days at a time.\"\n",
      "\"Away, is he?\" said Holmes, in a disappointed voice.\n",
      "\"I am sorry for that, for I wanted to speak to Mr. Smith.\"\n",
      "\"He's been away since yesterday mornin', sir, and, truth to tell, I am beginnin' to feel frightened about him. But if it was about a boat, sir, maybe I could serve as well.\"\n",
      "\"I wanted to hire his steam launch.\"\n",
      "\"Why, bless you, sir, it is in the steam launch that he has gone. That's what puzzles me; for I know there ain't more coals in her than would take her to about Woolwich and back. If he'd been away in the barge I'd ha' thought nothin'; for many a time a job has taken him as far as Gravesend, and then if there was much doin' there he might ha' stayed over. But what good is a steam launch without coals?\"\n",
      "\"He might have bought some at a wharf down the river.\"\n",
      "\"He might, sir, but it weren't his way. Many a time I've heard him call out at the prices they charge for a few odd bags. Besides, I don't like that wooden-legged man, wi' his ugly face and outlandish talk. What did he want always knockin' about here for?\"\n",
      "\"A wooden-legged man?\" said Holmes, with bland surprise.\n",
      "\"Yes, sir, a brown, monkey-faced chap that's called more'n once for my old man. It was him that roused him up yesternight, and, what's more, my man knew he was comin', for he had steam up in the launch. I tell you straight, sir, I don't feel easy in my mind about it.\"\n",
      "\"But, my dear Mrs. Smith,\" said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders, \"You are frightening yourself about nothing. How could you possibly tell that it was the wooden-legged man who came in the night? I don't quite understand how you can be so sure.\"\n",
      "\"His voice, sir. I knew his voice, which is kind o' thick and foggy. He tapped at the winder,--about three it would be. 'Show a leg, matey,' says he: 'time to turn out guard.' My old man woke up Jim,--that's my eldest,--and away they went, without so much as a word to me. I could hear the wooden leg clackin' on the stones.\"\n",
      "\"And was this wooden-legged man alone?\"\n",
      "\"Couldn't say, I am sure, sir. I didn't hear no one else.\"\n",
      "\"I am sorry, Mrs. Smith, for I wanted a steam launch, and I have heard good reports of the--Let me see, what is her name?\"\n",
      "\"The Aurora, sir.\"\n",
      "\"Ah! She's not that old green launch with a yellow line, very broad in the beam?\"\n",
      "\"No, indeed. She's as trim a little thing as any on the river. She's been fresh painted, black with two red streaks.\"\n",
      "\"Thanks. I hope that you will hear soon from Mr. Smith. I am going down the river; and if I should see anything of the Aurora I shall let him know that you are uneasy. A black funnel, you say?\"\n",
      "\"No, sir. Black with a white band.\"\n",
      "\"Ah, of course.\n",
      "It was the sides which were black.\n",
      "Good-morning, Mrs. Smith.\n",
      "--There is a boatman here with a wherry, Watson.\n",
      "We shall take it and cross the river.\n",
      "\"The main thing with people of that sort,\" said Holmes, as we sat in the sheets of the wherry, \"is never to let them think that their information can be of the slightest importance to you. If you do, they will instantly shut up like an oyster. If you listen to them under protest, as it were, you are very likely to get what you want.\"\n",
      "\"Our course now seems pretty clear,\" said I.\n",
      "\"What would you do, then?\"\n",
      "\"I would engage a launch and go down the river on the track of the Aurora.\"\n",
      "\"My dear fellow, it would be a colossal task. She may have touched at any wharf on either side of the stream between here and Greenwich. Below the bridge there is a perfect labyrinth of landing-places for miles. It would take you days and days to exhaust them, if you set about it alone.\"\n",
      "\"Employ the police, then.\"\n",
      "\"No. I shall probably call Athelney Jones in at the last moment. He is not a bad fellow, and I should not like to do anything which would injure him professionally. But I have a fancy for working it out myself, now that we have gone so far.\"\n",
      "\"Could we advertise, then, asking for information from wharfingers?\"\n",
      "\"Worse and worse! Our men would know that the chase was hot at their heels, and they would be off out of the country. As it is, they are likely enough to leave, but as long as they think they are perfectly safe they will be in no hurry. Jones's energy will be of use to us there, for his view of the case is sure to push itself into the daily press, and the runaways will think that every one is off on the wrong scent.\"\n",
      "\"What are we to do, then?\"\n",
      "I asked, as we landed near Millbank Penitentiary.\n",
      "\"Take this hansom, drive home, have some breakfast, and get an hour's sleep. It is quite on the cards that we may be afoot to-night again. Stop at a telegraph-office, cabby! We will keep Toby, for he may be of use to us yet.\"\n",
      "We pulled up at the Great Peter Street post-office, and Holmes despatched his wire.\n",
      "\"Whom do you think that is to?\" he asked, as we resumed our journey.\n",
      "\"I am sure I don't know.\"\n",
      "\"You remember the Baker Street division of the detective police force whom I employed in the Jefferson Hope case?\"\n",
      "\"Well,\" said I, laughing.\n",
      "\"This is just the case where they might be invaluable. If they fail, I have other resources; but I shall try them first. That wire was to my dirty little lieutenant, Wiggins, and I expect that he and his gang will be with us before we have finished our breakfast.\"\n",
      "It was between eight and nine o'clock now, and I was conscious of a strong reaction after the successive excitements of the night.\n",
      "I was limp and weary, befogged in mind and fatigued in body.\n",
      "I had not the professional enthusiasm which carried my companion on, nor could I look at the matter as a mere abstract intellectual problem.\n",
      "As far as the death of Bartholomew Sholto went, I had heard little good of him, and could feel no intense antipathy to his murderers.\n",
      "The treasure, however, was a different matter.\n",
      "That, or part of it, belonged rightfully to Miss Morstan.\n",
      "While there was a chance of recovering it I was ready to devote my life to the one object.\n",
      "True, if I found it it would probably put her forever beyond my reach.\n",
      "Yet it would be a petty and selfish love which would be influenced by such a thought as that.\n",
      "If Holmes could work to find the criminals, I had a tenfold stronger reason to urge me on to find the treasure.\n",
      "A bath at Baker Street and a complete change freshened me up wonderfully.\n",
      "When I came down to our room I found the breakfast laid and Holmes pouring out the coffee.\n",
      "\"Here it is,\" said he, laughing, and pointing to an open newspaper.\n",
      "\"The energetic Jones and the ubiquitous reporter have fixed it up between them. But you have had enough of the case. Better have your ham and eggs first.\"\n",
      "I took the paper from him and read the short notice, which was headed \"Mysterious Business at Upper Norwood.\"\n",
      "\"About twelve o'clock last night,\" said the Standard, \"Mr. Bartholomew Sholto, of Pondicherry Lodge, Upper Norwood, was found dead in his room under circumstances which point to foul play. As far as we can learn, no actual traces of violence were found upon Mr. Sholto's person, but a valuable collection of Indian gems which the deceased gentleman had inherited from his father has been carried off. The discovery was first made by Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, who had called at the house with Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, brother of the deceased. By a singular piece of good fortune, Mr. Athelney Jones, the well-known member of the detective police force, happened to be at the Norwood Police Station, and was on the ground within half an hour of the first alarm. His trained and experienced faculties were at once directed towards the detection of the criminals, with the gratifying result that the brother, Thaddeus Sholto, has already been arrested, together with the housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, an Indian butler named Lal Rao, and a porter, or gatekeeper, named McMurdo. It is quite certain that the thief or thieves were well acquainted with the house, for Mr. Jones's well-known technical knowledge and his powers of minute observation have enabled him to prove conclusively that the miscreants could not have entered by the door or by the window, but must have made their way across the roof of the building, and so through a trap-door into a room which communicated with that in which the body was found. This fact, which has been very clearly made out, proves conclusively that it was no mere haphazard burglary. The prompt and energetic action of the officers of the law shows the great advantage of the presence on such occasions of a single vigorous and masterful mind. We cannot but think that it supplies an argument to those who would wish to see our detectives more decentralized, and so brought into closer and more effective touch with the cases which it is their duty to investigate.\"\n",
      "\"Isn't it gorgeous!\" said Holmes, grinning over his coffee-cup.\n",
      "\"What do you think of it?\"\n",
      "\"I think that we have had a close shave ourselves of being arrested for the crime.\"\n",
      "\"So do I. I wouldn't answer for our safety now, if he should happen to have another of his attacks of energy.\"\n",
      "At this moment there was a loud ring at the bell, and I could hear Mrs. Hudson, our landlady, raising her voice in a wail of expostulation and dismay.\n",
      "\"By heaven, Holmes,\" I said, half rising, \"I believe that they are really after us.\"\n",
      "\"No, it's not quite so bad as that. It is the unofficial force,--the Baker Street irregulars.\"\n",
      "As he spoke, there came a swift pattering of naked feet upon the stairs, a clatter of high voices, and in rushed a dozen dirty and ragged little street-Arabs.\n",
      "There was some show of discipline among them, despite their tumultuous entry, for they instantly drew up in line and stood facing us with expectant faces.\n",
      "One of their number, taller and older than the others, stood forward with an air of lounging superiority which was very funny in such a disreputable little carecrow.\n",
      "\"Got your message, sir,\" said he, \"and brought 'em on sharp. Three bob and a tanner for tickets.\"\n",
      "\"Here you are,\" said Holmes, producing some silver.\n",
      "\"In future they can report to you, Wiggins, and you to me. I cannot have the house invaded in this way. However, it is just as well that you should all hear the instructions. I want to find the whereabouts of a steam launch called the Aurora, owner Mordecai Smith, black with two red streaks, funnel black with a white band. She is down the river somewhere. I want one boy to be at Mordecai Smith's landing-stage opposite Millbank to say if the boat comes back. You must divide it out among yourselves, and do both banks thoroughly. Let me know the moment you have news. Is that all clear?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, guv'nor,\" said Wiggins.\n",
      "\"The old scale of pay, and a guinea to the boy who finds the boat. Here's a day in advance. Now off you go!\"\n",
      "He handed them a shilling each, and away they buzzed down the stairs, and I saw them a moment later streaming down the street.\n",
      "\"If the launch is above water they will find her,\" said Holmes, as he rose from the table and lit his pipe.\n",
      "\"They can go everywhere, see everything, overhear every one. I expect to hear before evening that they have spotted her. In the mean while, we can do nothing but await results. We cannot pick up the broken trail until we find either the Aurora or Mr. Mordecai Smith.\"\n",
      "\"Toby could eat these scraps, I dare say. Are you going to bed, Holmes?\"\n",
      "\"No: I am not tired. I have a curious constitution. I never remember feeling tired by work, though idleness exhausts me completely. I am going to smoke and to think over this queer business to which my fair client has introduced us. If ever man had an easy task, this of ours ought to be. Wooden-legged men are not so common, but the other man must, I should think, be absolutely unique.\"\n",
      "\"That other man again!\"\n",
      "\"I have no wish to make a mystery of him,--to you, anyway. But you must have formed your own opinion. Now, do consider the data. Diminutive footmarks, toes never fettered by boots, naked feet, stone-headed wooden mace, great agility, small poisoned darts. What do you make of all this?\"\n",
      "\"A savage!\"\n",
      "I exclaimed.\n",
      "\"Perhaps one of those Indians who were the associates of Jonathan Small.\"\n",
      "\"Hardly that,\" said he.\n",
      "\"When first I saw signs of strange weapons I was inclined to think so; but the remarkable character of the footmarks caused me to reconsider my views. Some of the inhabitants of the Indian Peninsula are small men, but none could have left such marks as that. The Hindoo proper has long and thin feet. The sandal-wearing Mohammedan has the great toe well separated from the others, because the thong is commonly passed between. These little darts, too, could only be shot in one way. They are from a blow-pipe. Now, then, where are we to find our savage?\"\n",
      "\"South American,\" I hazarded.\n",
      "He stretched his hand up, and took down a bulky volume from the shelf.\n",
      "\"This is the first volume of a gazetteer which is now being published. It may be looked upon as the very latest authority. What have we here? 'Andaman Islands, situated 340 miles to the north of Sumatra, in the Bay of Bengal.' Hum! hum! What's all this? Moist climate, coral reefs, sharks, Port Blair, convict-barracks, Rutland Island, cottonwoods--Ah, here we are. 'The aborigines of the Andaman Islands may perhaps claim the distinction of being the smallest race upon this earth, though some anthropologists prefer the Bushmen of Africa, the Digger Indians of America, and the Terra del Fuegians. The average height is rather below four feet, although many full-grown adults may be found who are very much smaller than this. They are a fierce, morose, and intractable people, though capable of forming most devoted friendships when their confidence has once been gained.' Mark that, Watson. Now, then, listen to this. 'They are naturally hideous, having large, misshapen heads, small, fierce eyes, and distorted features. Their feet and hands, however, are remarkably small. So intractable and fierce are they that all the efforts of the British official have failed to win them over in any degree. They have always been a terror to shipwrecked crews, braining the survivors with their stone-headed clubs, or shooting them with their poisoned arrows. These massacres are invariably concluded by a cannibal feast.' Nice, amiable people, Watson! If this fellow had been left to his own unaided devices this affair might have taken an even more ghastly turn. I fancy that, even as it is, Jonathan Small would give a good deal not to have employed him.\"\n",
      "\"But how came he to have so singular a companion?\"\n",
      "\"Ah, that is more than I can tell. Since, however, we had already determined that Small had come from the Andamans, it is not so very wonderful that this islander should be with him. No doubt we shall know all about it in time. Look here, Watson; you look regularly done. Lie down there on the sofa, and see if I can put you to sleep.\"\n",
      "He took up his violin from the corner, and as I stretched myself out he began to play some low, dreamy, melodious air,--his own, no doubt, for he had a remarkable gift for improvisation.\n",
      "I have a vague remembrance of his gaunt limbs, his earnest face, and the rise and fall of his bow.\n",
      "Then I seemed to be floated peacefully away upon a soft sea of sound, until I found myself in dream-land, with the sweet face of Mary Morstan looking down upon me.\n",
      "CHAPTER IX A Break in the Chain\n",
      "It was late in the afternoon before I woke, strengthened and refreshed.\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes still sat exactly as I had left him, save that he had laid aside his violin and was deep in a book.\n",
      "He looked across at me, as I stirred, and I noticed that his face was dark and troubled.\n",
      "\"You have slept soundly,\" he said.\n",
      "\"I feared that our talk would wake you.\"\n",
      "\"I heard nothing,\" I answered.\n",
      "\"Have you had fresh news, then?\"\n",
      "\"Unfortunately, no. I confess that I am surprised and disappointed. I expected something definite by this time. Wiggins has just been up to report. He says that no trace can be found of the launch. It is a provoking check, for every hour is of importance.\"\n",
      "\"Can I do anything? I am perfectly fresh now, and quite ready for another night's outing.\"\n",
      "\"No, we can do nothing. We can only wait. If we go ourselves, the message might come in our absence, and delay be caused. You can do what you will, but I must remain on guard.\"\n",
      "\"Then I shall run over to Camberwell and call upon Mrs. Cecil Forrester. She asked me to, yesterday.\"\n",
      "\"On Mrs. Cecil Forrester?\" asked Holmes, with the twinkle of a smile in his eyes.\n",
      "\"Well, of course Miss Morstan too. They were anxious to hear what happened.\"\n",
      "\"I would not tell them too much,\" said Holmes.\n",
      "\"Women are never to be entirely trusted,--not the best of them.\"\n",
      "I did not pause to argue over this atrocious sentiment.\n",
      "\"I shall be back in an hour or two,\" I remarked.\n",
      "\"All right! Good luck! But, I say, if you are crossing the river you may as well return Toby, for I don't think it is at all likely that we shall have any use for him now.\"\n",
      "I took our mongrel accordingly, and left him, together with a half-sovereign, at the old naturalist's in Pinchin Lane.\n",
      "At Camberwell I found Miss Morstan a little weary after her night's adventures, but very eager to hear the news.\n",
      "Mrs. Forrester, too, was full of curiosity.\n",
      "I told them all that we had done, suppressing, however, the more dreadful parts of the tragedy.\n",
      "Thus, although I spoke of Mr. Sholto's death, I said nothing of the exact manner and method of it.\n",
      "With all my omissions, however, there was enough to startle and amaze them.\n",
      "\"It is a romance!\" cried Mrs. Forrester.\n",
      "\"An injured lady, half a million in treasure, a black cannibal, and a wooden-legged ruffian. They take the place of the conventional dragon or wicked earl.\"\n",
      "\"And two knight-errants to the rescue,\" added Miss Morstan, with a bright glance at me.\n",
      "\"Why, Mary, your fortune depends upon the issue of this search. I don't think that you are nearly excited enough. Just imagine what it must be to be so rich, and to have the world at your feet!\"\n",
      "It sent a little thrill of joy to my heart to notice that she showed no sign of elation at the prospect.\n",
      "On the contrary, she gave a toss of her proud head, as though the matter were one in which she took small interest.\n",
      "\"It is for Mr. Thaddeus Sholto that I am anxious,\" she said.\n",
      "\"Nothing else is of any consequence; but I think that he has behaved most kindly and honorably throughout. It is our duty to clear him of this dreadful and unfounded charge.\"\n",
      "It was evening before I left Camberwell, and quite dark by the time I reached home.\n",
      "My companion's book and pipe lay by his chair, but he had disappeared.\n",
      "I looked about in the hope of seeing a note, but there was none.\n",
      "\"I suppose that Mr. Sherlock Holmes has gone out,\" I said to Mrs. Hudson as she came up to lower the blinds.\n",
      "\"No, sir. He has gone to his room, sir. Do you know, sir,\" sinking her voice into an impressive whisper, \"I am afraid for his health?\"\n",
      "\"Why so, Mrs. Hudson?\"\n",
      "\"Well, he's that strange, sir. After you was gone he walked and he walked, up and down, and up and down, until I was weary of the sound of his footstep. Then I heard him talking to himself and muttering, and every time the bell rang out he came on the stairhead, with 'What is that, Mrs. Hudson?' And now he has slammed off to his room, but I can hear him walking away the same as ever. I hope he's not going to be ill, sir. I ventured to say something to him about cooling medicine, but he turned on me, sir, with such a look that I don't know how ever I got out of the room.\"\n",
      "\"I don't think that you have any cause to be uneasy, Mrs. Hudson,\" I answered.\n",
      "\"I have seen him like this before. He has some small matter upon his mind which makes him restless.\"\n",
      "I tried to speak lightly to our worthy landlady, but I was myself somewhat uneasy when through the long night I still from time to time heard the dull sound of his tread, and knew how his keen spirit was chafing against this involuntary inaction.\n",
      "At breakfast-time he looked worn and haggard, with a little fleck of feverish color upon either cheek.\n",
      "\"You are knocking yourself up, old man,\" I remarked.\n",
      "\"I heard you marching about in the night.\"\n",
      "\"No, I could not sleep,\" he answered.\n",
      "\"This infernal problem is consuming me. It is too much to be balked by so petty an obstacle, when all else had been overcome. I know the men, the launch, everything; and yet I can get no news. I have set other agencies at work, and used every means at my disposal. The whole river has been searched on either side, but there is no news, nor has Mrs. Smith heard of her husband. I shall come to the conclusion soon that they have scuttled the craft. But there are objections to that.\"\n",
      "\"Or that Mrs. Smith has put us on a wrong scent.\"\n",
      "\"No, I think that may be dismissed. I had inquiries made, and there is a launch of that description.\"\n",
      "\"Could it have gone up the river?\"\n",
      "\"I have considered that possibility too, and there is a search-party who will work up as far as Richmond. If no news comes to-day, I shall start off myself to-morrow, and go for the men rather than the boat. But surely, surely, we shall hear something.\"\n",
      "We did not, however.\n",
      "Not a word came to us either from Wiggins or from the other agencies.\n",
      "There were articles in most of the papers upon the Norwood tragedy.\n",
      "They all appeared to be rather hostile to the unfortunate Thaddeus Sholto.\n",
      "No fresh details were to be found, however, in any of them, save that an inquest was to be held upon the following day.\n",
      "I walked over to Camberwell in the evening to report our ill success to the ladies, and on my return I found Holmes dejected and somewhat morose.\n",
      "He would hardly reply to my questions, and busied himself all evening in an abstruse chemical analysis which involved much heating of retorts and distilling of vapors, ending at last in a smell which fairly drove me out of the apartment.\n",
      "Up to the small hours of the morning I could hear the clinking of his test-tubes which told me that he was still engaged in his malodorous experiment.\n",
      "In the early dawn I woke with a start, and was surprised to find him standing by my bedside, clad in a rude sailor dress with a pea-jacket, and a coarse red scarf round his neck.\n",
      "\"I am off down the river, Watson,\" said he.\n",
      "\"I have been turning it over in my mind, and I can see only one way out of it. It is worth trying, at all events.\"\n",
      "\"Surely I can come with you, then?\" said I.\n",
      "\"No; you can be much more useful if you will remain here as my representative. I am loath to go, for it is quite on the cards that some message may come during the day, though Wiggins was despondent about it last night. I want you to open all notes and telegrams, and to act on your own judgment if any news should come. Can I rely upon you?\"\n",
      "\"Most certainly.\"\n",
      "\"I am afraid that you will not be able to wire to me, for I can hardly tell yet where I may find myself. If I am in luck, however, I may not be gone so very long. I shall have news of some sort or other before I get back.\"\n",
      "I had heard nothing of him by breakfast-time.\n",
      "On opening the Standard, however, I found that there was a fresh allusion to the business.\n",
      "\"With reference to the Upper Norwood tragedy,\" it remarked, \"we have reason to believe that the matter promises to be even more complex and mysterious than was originally supposed. Fresh evidence has shown that it is quite impossible that Mr. Thaddeus Sholto could have been in any way concerned in the matter. He and the housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, were both released yesterday evening. It is believed, however, that the police have a clue as to the real culprits, and that it is being prosecuted by Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard, with all his well-known energy and sagacity. Further arrests may be expected at any moment.\"\n",
      "\"That is satisfactory so far as it goes,\" thought I. \"Friend Sholto is safe, at any rate. I wonder what the fresh clue may be; though it seems to be a stereotyped form whenever the police have made a blunder.\"\n",
      "I tossed the paper down upon the table, but at that moment my eye caught an advertisement in the agony column.\n",
      "It ran in this way:\n",
      "\"Lost.--Whereas Mordecai Smith, boatman, and his son, Jim, left Smith's Wharf at or about three o'clock last Tuesday morning in the steam launch Aurora, black with two red stripes, funnel black with a white band, the sum of five pounds will be paid to any one who can give information to Mrs. Smith, at Smith's Wharf, or at 221b Baker Street, as to the whereabouts of the said Mordecai Smith and the launch Aurora.\"\n",
      "This was clearly Holmes's doing.\n",
      "The Baker Street address was enough to prove that.\n",
      "It struck me as rather ingenious, because it might be read by the fugitives without their seeing in it more than the natural anxiety of a wife for her missing husband.\n",
      "It was a long day.\n",
      "Every time that a knock came to the door, or a sharp step passed in the street, I imagined that it was either Holmes returning or an answer to his advertisement.\n",
      "I tried to read, but my thoughts would wander off to our strange quest and to the ill-assorted and villainous pair whom we were pursuing.\n",
      "Could there be, I wondered, some radical flaw in my companion's reasoning.\n",
      "Might he be suffering from some huge self-deception?\n",
      "Was it not possible that his nimble and speculative mind had built up this wild theory upon faulty premises?\n",
      "I had never known him to be wrong; and yet the keenest reasoner may occasionally be deceived.\n",
      "He was likely, I thought, to fall into error through the over-refinement of his logic,--his preference for a subtle and bizarre explanation when a plainer and more commonplace one lay ready to his hand.\n",
      "Yet, on the other hand, I had myself seen the evidence, and I had heard the reasons for his deductions.\n",
      "When I looked back on the long chain of curious circumstances, many of them trivial in themselves, but all tending in the same direction, I could not disguise from myself that even if Holmes's explanation were incorrect the true theory must be equally outré and startling.\n",
      "At three o'clock in the afternoon there was a loud peal at the bell, an authoritative voice in the hall, and, to my surprise, no less a person than Mr. Athelney Jones was shown up to me.\n",
      "Very different was he, however, from the brusque and masterful professor of common sense who had taken over the case so confidently at Upper Norwood.\n",
      "His expression was downcast, and his bearing meek and even apologetic.\n",
      "\"Good-day, sir; good-day,\" said he.\n",
      "\"Mr. Sherlock Holmes is out, I understand.\"\n",
      "\"Yes, and I cannot be sure when he will be back. But perhaps you would care to wait. Take that chair and try one of these cigars.\"\n",
      "\"Thank you; I don't mind if I do,\" said he, mopping his face with a red bandanna handkerchief.\n",
      "\"And a whiskey-and-soda?\"\n",
      "\"Well, half a glass. It is very hot for the time of year; and I have had a good deal to worry and try me. You know my theory about this Norwood case?\"\n",
      "\"I remember that you expressed one.\"\n",
      "\"Well, I have been obliged to reconsider it. I had my net drawn tightly round Mr. Sholto, sir, when pop he went through a hole in the middle of it. He was able to prove an alibi which could not be shaken. From the time that he left his brother's room he was never out of sight of some one or other. So it could not be he who climbed over roofs and through trap-doors. It's a very dark case, and my professional credit is at stake. I should be very glad of a little assistance.\"\n",
      "\"We all need help sometimes,\" said I.\n",
      "\"Your friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes is a wonderful man, sir,\" said he, in a husky and confidential voice.\n",
      "\"He's a man who is not to be beat. I have known that young man go into a good many cases, but I never saw the case yet that he could not throw a light upon. He is irregular in his methods, and a little quick perhaps in jumping at theories, but, on the whole, I think he would have made a most promising officer, and I don't care who knows it. I have had a wire from him this morning, by which I understand that he has got some clue to this Sholto business. Here is the message.\"\n",
      "He took the telegram out of his pocket, and handed it to me.\n",
      "It was dated from Poplar at twelve o'clock.\n",
      "\"Go to Baker Street at once,\" it said.\n",
      "\"If I have not returned, wait for me. I am close on the track of the Sholto gang. You can come with us to-night if you want to be in at the finish.\"\n",
      "\"This sounds well. He has evidently picked up the scent again,\" said I.\n",
      "\"Ah, then he has been at fault too,\" exclaimed Jones, with evident satisfaction.\n",
      "\"Even the best of us are thrown off sometimes. Of course this may prove to be a false alarm; but it is my duty as an officer of the law to allow no chance to slip. But there is some one at the door. Perhaps this is he.\"\n",
      "A heavy step was heard ascending the stair, with a great wheezing and rattling as from a man who was sorely put to it for breath.\n",
      "Once or twice he stopped, as though the climb were too much for him, but at last he made his way to our door and entered.\n",
      "His appearance corresponded to the sounds which we had heard.\n",
      "He was an aged man, clad in seafaring garb, with an old pea-jacket buttoned up to his throat.\n",
      "His back was bowed, his knees were shaky, and his breathing was painfully asthmatic.\n",
      "As he leaned upon a thick oaken cudgel his shoulders heaved in the effort to draw the air into his lungs.\n",
      "He had a colored scarf round his chin, and I could see little of his face save a pair of keen dark eyes, overhung by bushy white brows, and long gray side-whiskers.\n",
      "Altogether he gave me the impression of a respectable master mariner who had fallen into years and poverty.\n",
      "\"What is it, my man?\"\n",
      "I asked.\n",
      "He looked about him in the slow methodical fashion of old age.\n",
      "\"Is Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?\" said he.\n",
      "\"No; but I am acting for him. You can tell me any message you have for him.\"\n",
      "\"It was to him himself I was to tell it,\" said he.\n",
      "\"But I tell you that I am acting for him. Was it about Mordecai Smith's boat?\"\n",
      "\"Yes. I knows well where it is. An' I knows where the men he is after are. An' I knows where the treasure is. I knows all about it.\"\n",
      "\"Then tell me, and I shall let him know.\"\n",
      "\"It was to him I was to tell it,\" he repeated, with the petulant obstinacy of a very old man.\n",
      "\"Well, you must wait for him.\"\n",
      "\"No, no; I ain't goin' to lose a whole day to please no one. If Mr. Holmes ain't here, then Mr. Holmes must find it all out for himself. I don't care about the look of either of you, and I won't tell a word.\"\n",
      "He shuffled towards the door, but Athelney Jones got in front of him.\n",
      "\"Wait a bit, my friend,\" said he.\n",
      "\"You have important information, and you must not walk off. We shall keep you, whether you like or not, until our friend returns.\"\n",
      "The old man made a little run towards the door, but, as Athelney Jones put his broad back up against it, he recognized the uselessness of resistance.\n",
      "\"Pretty sort o' treatment this!\" he cried, stamping his stick.\n",
      "\"I come here to see a gentleman, and you two, who I never saw in my life, seize me and treat me in this fashion!\"\n",
      "\"You will be none the worse,\" I said.\n",
      "\"We shall recompense you for the loss of your time. Sit over here on the sofa, and you will not have long to wait.\"\n",
      "He came across sullenly enough, and seated himself with his face resting on his hands.\n",
      "Jones and I resumed our cigars and our talk.\n",
      "Suddenly, however, Holmes's voice broke in upon us.\n",
      "\"I think that you might offer me a cigar too,\" he said.\n",
      "We both started in our chairs.\n",
      "There was Holmes sitting close to us with an air of quiet amusement.\n",
      "\"Holmes!\"\n",
      "I exclaimed.\n",
      "\"You here! But where is the old man?\"\n",
      "\"Here is the old man,\" said he, holding out a heap of white hair.\n",
      "\"Here he is,--wig, whiskers, eyebrows, and all. I thought my disguise was pretty good, but I hardly expected that it would stand that test.\"\n",
      "\"Ah, you rogue!\" cried Jones, highly delighted.\n",
      "\"You would have made an actor, and a rare one. You had the proper workhouse cough, and those weak legs of yours are worth ten pound a week. I thought I knew the glint of your eye, though. You didn't get away from us so easily, you see.\"\n",
      "\"I have been working in that get-up all day,\" said he, lighting his cigar.\n",
      "\"You see, a good many of the criminal classes begin to know me,--especially since our friend here took to publishing some of my cases: so I can only go on the war-path under some simple disguise like this. You got my wire?\"\n",
      "\"Yes; that was what brought me here.\"\n",
      "\"How has your case prospered?\"\n",
      "\"It has all come to nothing. I have had to release two of my prisoners, and there is no evidence against the other two.\"\n",
      "\"Never mind. We shall give you two others in the place of them. But you must put yourself under my orders. You are welcome to all the official credit, but you must act on the line that I point out. Is that agreed?\"\n",
      "\"Entirely, if you will help me to the men.\"\n",
      "\"Well, then, in the first place I shall want a fast police-boat--a steam launch--to be at the Westminster Stairs at seven o'clock.\"\n",
      "\"That is easily managed. There is always one about there; but I can step across the road and telephone to make sure.\"\n",
      "\"Then I shall want two stanch men, in case of resistance.\"\n",
      "\"There will be two or three in the boat. What else?\"\n",
      "\"When we secure the men we shall get the treasure. I think that it would be a pleasure to my friend here to take the box round to the young lady to whom half of it rightfully belongs. Let her be the first to open it.--Eh, Watson?\"\n",
      "\"It would be a great pleasure to me.\"\n",
      "\"Rather an irregular proceeding,\" said Jones, shaking his head.\n",
      "\"However, the whole thing is irregular, and I suppose we must wink at it. The treasure must afterwards be handed over to the authorities until after the official investigation.\"\n",
      "\"Certainly. That is easily managed. One other point. I should much like to have a few details about this matter from the lips of Jonathan Small himself. You know I like to work the detail of my cases out. There is no objection to my having an unofficial interview with him, either here in my rooms or elsewhere, as long as he is efficiently guarded?\"\n",
      "\"Well, you are master of the situation. I have had no proof yet of the existence of this Jonathan Small. However, if you can catch him I don't see how I can refuse you an interview with him.\"\n",
      "\"That is understood, then?\"\n",
      "\"Perfectly. Is there anything else?\"\n",
      "\"Only that I insist upon your dining with us. It will be ready in half an hour. I have oysters and a brace of grouse, with something a little choice in white wines.--Watson, you have never yet recognized my merits as a housekeeper.\"\n",
      "CHAPTER X The End of the Islander\n",
      "Our meal was a merry one.\n",
      "Holmes coud talk exceedingly well when he chose, and that night he did choose.\n",
      "He appeared to be in a state of nervous exaltation.\n",
      "I have never known him so brilliant.\n",
      "He spoke on a quick succession of subjects,--on miracle-plays, on medieval pottery, on Stradivarius violins, on the Buddhism of Ceylon, and on the war-ships of the future,--handling each as though he had made a special study of it.\n",
      "His bright humor marked the reaction from his black depression of the preceding days.\n",
      "Athelney Jones proved to be a sociable soul in his hours of relaxation, and face his dinner with the air of a bon vivant.\n",
      "For myself, I felt elated at the thought that we were nearing the end of our task, and I caught something of Holmes's gaiety.\n",
      "None of us alluded during dinner to the cause which had brought us together.\n",
      "When the cloth was cleared, Holmes glanced at this watch, and filled up three glasses with port.\n",
      "\"One bumper,\" said he, \"to the success of our little expedition. And now it is high time we were off. Have you a pistol, Watson?\"\n",
      "\"I have my old service-revolver in my desk.\"\n",
      "\"You had best take it, then. It is well to be prepared. I see that the cab is at the door. I ordered it for half-past six.\"\n",
      "It was a little past seven before we reached the Westminster wharf, and found our launch awaiting us.\n",
      "Holmes eyed it critically.\n",
      "\"Is there anything to mark it as a police-boat?\"\n",
      "\"Yes,--that green lamp at the side.\"\n",
      "\"Then take it off.\"\n",
      "The small change was made, we stepped on board, and the ropes were cast off.\n",
      "Jones, Holmes, and I sat in the stern.\n",
      "There was one man at the rudder, one to tend the engines, and two burly police-inspectors forward.\n",
      "\"Where to?\" asked Jones.\n",
      "\"To the Tower. Tell them to stop opposite Jacobson's Yard.\"\n",
      "Our craft was evidently a very fast one.\n",
      "We shot past the long lines of loaded barges as though they were stationary.\n",
      "Holmes smiled with satisfaction as we overhauled a river steamer and left her behind us.\n",
      "\"We ought to be able to catch anything on the river,\" he said.\n",
      "\"Well, hardly that. But there are not many launches to beat us.\"\n",
      "\"We shall have to catch the Aurora, and she has a name for being a clipper. I will tell you how the land lies, Watson. You recollect how annoyed I was at being balked by so small a thing?\"\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\"Well, I gave my mind a thorough rest by plunging into a chemical analysis. One of our greatest statesmen has said that a change of work is the best rest. So it is. When I had succeeded in dissolving the hydrocarbon which I was at work at, I came back to our problem of the Sholtos, and thought the whole matter out again. My boys had been up the river and down the river without result. The launch was not at any landing-stage or wharf, nor had it returned. Yet it could hardly have been scuttled to hide their traces,--though that always remained as a possible hypothesis if all else failed. I knew this man Small had a certain degree of low cunning, but I did not think him capable of anything in the nature of delicate finesse. That is usually a product of higher education. I then reflected that since he had certainly been in London some time--as we had evidence that he maintained a continual watch over Pondicherry Lodge--he could hardly leave at a moment's notice, but would need some little time, if it were only a day, to arrange his affairs. That was the balance of probability, at any rate.\"\n",
      "\"It seems to me to be a little weak,\" said I. \"It is more probable that he had arranged his affairs before ever he set out upon his expedition.\"\n",
      "\"No, I hardly think so. This lair of his would be too valuable a retreat in case of need for him to give it up until he was sure that he could do without it. But a second consideration struck me. Jonathan Small must have felt that the peculiar appearance of his companion, however much he may have top-coated him, would give rise to gossip, and possibly be associated with this Norwood tragedy. He was quite sharp enough to see that. They had started from their head-quarters under cover of darkness, and he would wish to get back before it was broad light. Now, it was past three o'clock, according to Mrs. Smith, when they got the boat. It would be quite bright, and people would be about in an hour or so. Therefore, I argued, they did not go very far. They paid Smith well to hold his tongue, reserved his launch for the final escape, and hurried to their lodgings with the treasure-box. In a couple of nights, when they had time to see what view the papers took, and whether there was any suspicion, they would make their way under cover of darkness to some ship at Gravesend or in the Downs, where no doubt they had already arranged for passages to America or the Colonies.\"\n",
      "\"But the launch? They could not have taken that to their lodgings.\"\n",
      "\"Quite so. I argued that the launch must be no great way off, in spite of its invisibility. I then put myself in the place of Small, and looked at it as a man of his capacity would. He would probably consider that to send back the launch or to keep it at a wharf would make pursuit easy if the police did happen to get on his track. How, then, could he conceal the launch and yet have her at hand when wanted? I wondered what I should do myself if I were in his shoes. I could only think of one way of doing it. I might land the launch over to some boat-builder or repairer, with directions to make a trifling change in her. She would then be removed to his shed or hard, and so be effectually concealed, while at the same time I could have her at a few hours' notice.\"\n",
      "\"That seems simple enough.\"\n",
      "\"It is just these very simple things which are extremely liable to be overlooked. However, I determined to act on the idea. I started at once in this harmless seaman's rig and inquired at all the yards down the river. I drew blank at fifteen, but at the sixteenth--Jacobson's--I learned that the Aurora had been handed over to them two days ago by a wooden-legged man, with some trivial directions as to her rudder. 'There ain't naught amiss with her rudder,' said the foreman. 'There she lies, with the red streaks.' At that moment who should come down but Mordecai Smith, the missing owner? He was rather the worse for liquor. I should not, of course, have known him, but he bellowed out his name and the name of his launch. 'I want her to-night at eight o'clock,' said he,--'eight o'clock sharp, mind, for I have two gentlemen who won't be kept waiting.' They had evidently paid him well, for he was very flush of money, chucking shillings about to the men. I followed him some distance, but he subsided into an ale-house: so I went back to the yard, and, happening to pick up one of my boys on the way, I stationed him as a sentry over the launch. He is to stand at water's edge and wave his handkerchief to us when they start. We shall be lying off in the stream, and it will be a strange thing if we do not take men, treasure, and all.\"\n",
      "\"You have planned it all very neatly, whether they are the right men or not,\" said Jones; \"but if the affair were in my hands I should have had a body of police in Jacobson's Yard, and arrested them when they came down.\"\n",
      "\"Which would have been never. This man Small is a pretty shrewd fellow. He would send a scout on ahead, and if anything made him suspicious lie snug for another week.\"\n",
      "\"But you might have stuck to Mordecai Smith, and so been led to their hiding-place,\" said I.\n",
      "\"In that case I should have wasted my day. I think that it is a hundred to one against Smith knowing where they live. As long as he has liquor and good pay, why should he ask questions? They send him messages what to do. No, I thought over every possible course, and this is the best.\"\n",
      "While this conversation had been proceeding, we had been shooting the long series of bridges which span the Thames.\n",
      "As we passed the City the last rays of the sun were gilding the cross upon the summit of St. Paul's.\n",
      "It was twilight before we reached the Tower.\n",
      "\"That is Jacobson's Yard,\" said Holmes, pointing to a bristle of masts and rigging on the Surrey side.\n",
      "\"Cruise gently up and down here under cover of this string of lighters.\"\n",
      "He took a pair of night-glasses from his pocket and gazed some time at the shore.\n",
      "\"I see my sentry at his post,\" he remarked, \"but no sign of a handkerchief.\"\n",
      "\"Suppose we go down-stream a short way and lie in wait for them,\" said Jones, eagerly.\n",
      "We were all eager by this time, even the policemen and stokers, who had a very vague idea of what was going forward.\n",
      "\"We have no right to take anything for granted,\" Holmes answered.\n",
      "\"It is certainly ten to one that they go down-stream, but we cannot be certain. From this point we can see the entrance of the yard, and they can hardly see us. It will be a clear night and plenty of light. We must stay where we are. See how the folk swarm over yonder in the gaslight.\"\n",
      "\"They are coming from work in the yard.\"\n",
      "\"Dirty-looking rascals, but I suppose every one has some little immortal spark concealed about him. You would not think it, to look at them. There is no a priori probability about it. A strange enigma is man!\"\n",
      "\"Some one calls him a soul concealed in an animal,\" I suggested.\n",
      "\"Winwood Reade is good upon the subject,\" said Holmes.\n",
      "\"He remarks that, while the individual man is an insoluble puzzle, in the aggregate he becomes a mathematical certainty. You can, for example, never foretell what any one man will do, but you can say with precision what an average number will be up to. Individuals vary, but percentages remain constant. So says the statistician. But do I see a handkerchief? Surely there is a white flutter over yonder.\"\n",
      "\"Yes, it is your boy,\" I cried.\n",
      "\"I can see him plainly.\"\n",
      "\"And there is the Aurora,\" exclaimed Holmes, \"and going like the devil! Full speed ahead, engineer. Make after that launch with the yellow light. By heaven, I shall never forgive myself if she proves to have the heels of us!\"\n",
      "She had slipped unseen through the yard-entrance and passed behind two or three small craft, so that she had fairly got her speed up before we saw her.\n",
      "Now she was flying down the stream, near in to the shore, going at a tremendous rate.\n",
      "Jones looked gravely at her and shook his head.\n",
      "\"She is very fast,\" he said.\n",
      "\"I doubt if we shall catch her.\"\n",
      "\"We must catch her!\" cried Holmes, between his teeth.\n",
      "\"Heap it on, stokers! Make her do all she can! If we burn the boat we must have them!\"\n",
      "We were fairly after her now.\n",
      "The furnaces roared, and the powerful engines whizzed and clanked, like a great metallic heart.\n",
      "Her sharp, steep prow cut through the river-water and sent two rolling waves to right and to left of us.\n",
      "With every throb of the engines we sprang and quivered like a living thing.\n",
      "One great yellow lantern in our bows threw a long, flickering funnel of light in front of us.\n",
      "Right ahead a dark blur upon the water showed where the Aurora lay, and the swirl of white foam behind her spoke of the pace at which she was going.\n",
      "We flashed past barges, steamers, merchant-vessels, in and out, behind this one and round the other.\n",
      "Voices hailed us out of the darkness, but still the Aurora thundered on, and still we followed close upon her track.\n",
      "\"Pile it on, men, pile it on!\" cried Holmes, looking down into the engine-room, while the fierce glow from below beat upon his eager, aquiline face.\n",
      "\"Get every pound of steam you can.\"\n",
      "\"I think we gain a little,\" said Jones, with his eyes on the Aurora.\n",
      "\"I am sure of it,\" said I. \"We shall be up with her in a very few minutes.\"\n",
      "At that moment, however, as our evil fate would have it, a tug with three barges in tow blundered in between us.\n",
      "It was only by putting our helm hard down that we avoided a collision, and before we could round them and recover our way the Aurora had gained a good two hundred yards.\n",
      "She was still, however, well in view, and the murky uncertain twilight was setting into a clear starlit night.\n",
      "Our boilers were strained to their utmost, and the frail shell vibrated and creaked with the fierce energy which was driving us along.\n",
      "We had shot through the Pool, past the West India Docks, down the long Deptford Reach, and up again after rounding the Isle of Dogs.\n",
      "The dull blur in front of us resolved itself now clearly enough into the dainty Aurora.\n",
      "Jones turned our search-light upon her, so that we could plainly see the figures upon her deck.\n",
      "One man sat by the stern, with something black between his knees over which he stooped.\n",
      "Beside him lay a dark mass which looked like a Newfoundland dog.\n",
      "The boy held the tiller, while against the red glare of the furnace I could see old Smith, stripped to the waist, and shovelling coals for dear life.\n",
      "They may have had some doubt at first as to whether we were really pursuing them, but now as we followed every winding and turning which they took there could no longer be any question about it.\n",
      "At Greenwich we were about three hundred paces behind them.\n",
      "At Blackwall we could not have been more than two hundred and fifty.\n",
      "I have coursed many creatures in many countries during my checkered career, but never did sport give me such a wild thrill as this mad, flying man-hunt down the Thames.\n",
      "Steadily we drew in upon them, yard by yard.\n",
      "In the silence of the night we could hear the panting and clanking of their machinery.\n",
      "The man in the stern still crouched upon the deck, and his arms were moving as though he were busy, while every now and then he would look up and measure with a glance the distance which still separated us.\n",
      "Nearer we came and nearer.\n",
      "Jones yelled to them to stop.\n",
      "We were not more than four boat's lengths behind them, both boats flying at a tremendous pace.\n",
      "It was a clear reach of the river, with Barking Level upon one side and the melancholy Plumstead Marshes upon the other.\n",
      "At our hail the man in the stern sprang up from the deck and shook his two clinched fists at us, cursing the while in a high, cracked voice.\n",
      "He was a good-sized, powerful man, and as he stood poising himself with legs astride I could see that from the thigh downwards there was but a wooden stump upon the right side.\n",
      "At the sound of his strident, angry cries there was movement in the huddled bundle upon the deck.\n",
      "It straightened itself into a little black man--the smallest I have ever seen--with a great, misshapen head and a shock of tangled, dishevelled hair.\n",
      "Holmes had already drawn his revolver, and I whipped out mine at the sight of this savage, distorted creature.\n",
      "He was wrapped in some sort of dark ulster or blanket, which left only his face exposed; but that face was enough to give a man a sleepless night.\n",
      "Never have I seen features so deeply marked with all bestiality and cruelty.\n",
      "His small eyes glowed and burned with a sombre light, and his thick lips were writhed back from his teeth, which grinned and chattered at us with a half animal fury.\n",
      "\"Fire if he raises his hand,\" said Holmes, quietly.\n",
      "We were within a boat's-length by this time, and almost within touch of our quarry.\n",
      "I can see the two of them now as they stood, the white man with his legs far apart, shrieking out curses, and the unhallowed dwarf with his hideous face, and his strong yellow teeth gnashing at us in the light of our lantern.\n",
      "It was well that we had so clear a view of him.\n",
      "Even as we looked he plucked out from under his covering a short, round piece of wood, like a school-ruler, and clapped it to his lips.\n",
      "Our pistols rang out together.\n",
      "He whirled round, threw up his arms, and with a kind of choking cough fell sideways into the stream.\n",
      "I caught one glimpse of his venomous, menacing eyes amid the white swirl of the waters.\n",
      "At the same moment the wooden-legged man threw himself upon the rudder and put it hard down, so that his boat made straight in for the southern bank, while we shot past her stern, only clearing her by a few feet.\n",
      "We were round after her in an instant, but she was already nearly at the bank.\n",
      "It was a wild and desolate place, where the moon glimmered upon a wide expanse of marsh-land, with pools of stagnant water and beds of decaying vegetation.\n",
      "The launch with a dull thud ran up upon the mud-bank, with her bow in the air and her stern flush with the water.\n",
      "The fugitive sprang out, but his stump instantly sank its whole length into the sodden soil.\n",
      "In vain he struggled and writhed.\n",
      "Not one step could he possibly take either forwards or backwards.\n",
      "He yelled in impotent rage, and kicked frantically into the mud with his other foot, but his struggles only bored his wooden pin the deeper into the sticky bank.\n",
      "When we brought our launch alongside he was so firmly anchored that it was only by throwing the end of a rope over his shoulders that we were able to haul him out, and to drag him, like some evil fish, over our side.\n",
      "The two Smiths, father and son, sat sullenly in their launch, but came aboard meekly enough when commanded.\n",
      "The Aurora herself we hauled off and made fast to our stern.\n",
      "A solid iron chest of Indian workmanship stood upon the deck.\n",
      "This, there could be no question, was the same that had contained the ill-omened treasure of the Sholtos.\n",
      "There was no key, but it was of considerable weight, so we transferred it carefully to our own little cabin.\n",
      "As we steamed slowly up-stream again, we flashed our search-light in every direction, but there was no sign of the Islander.\n",
      "Somewhere in the dark ooze at the bottom of the Thames lie the bones of that strange visitor to our shores.\n",
      "\"See here,\" said Holmes, pointing to the wooden hatchway.\n",
      "\"We were hardly quick enough with our pistols.\"\n",
      "There, sure enough, just behind where we had been standing, stuck one of those murderous darts which we knew so well.\n",
      "It must have whizzed between us at the instant that we fired.\n",
      "Holmes smiled at it and shrugged his shoulders in his easy fashion, but I confess that it turned me sick to think of the horrible death which had passed so close to us that night.\n",
      "CHAPTER XI The Great Agra Treasure\n",
      "Our captive sat in the cabin opposite to the iron box which he had done so much and waited so long to gain.\n",
      "He was a sunburned, reckless-eyed fellow, with a net-work of lines and wrinkles all over his mahogany features, which told of a hard, open-air life.\n",
      "There was a singular prominence about his bearded chin which marked a man who was not to be easily turned from his purpose.\n",
      "His age may have been fifty or thereabouts, for his black, curly hair was thickly shot with gray.\n",
      "His face in repose was not an unpleasing one, though his heavy brows and aggressive chin gave him, as I had lately seen, a terrible expression when moved to anger.\n",
      "He sat now with his handcuffed hands upon his lap, and his head sunk upon his breast, while he looked with his keen, twinkling eyes at the box which had been the cause of his ill-doings.\n",
      "It seemed to me that there was more sorrow than anger in his rigid and contained countenance.\n",
      "Once he looked up at me with a gleam of something like humour in his eyes.\n",
      "\"Well, Jonathan Small,\" said Holmes, lighting a cigar, \"I am sorry that it has come to this.\"\n",
      "\"And so am I, sir,\" he answered, frankly.\n",
      "\"I don't believe that I can swing over the job. I give you my word on the book that I never raised hand against Mr. Sholto. It was that little hell-hound Tonga who shot one of his cursed darts into him. I had no part in it, sir. I was as grieved as if it had been my blood-relation. I welted the little devil with the slack end of the rope for it, but it was done, and I could not undo it again.\"\n",
      "\"Have a cigar,\" said Holmes; \"and you had best take a pull out of my flask, for you are very wet. How could you expect so small and weak a man as this black fellow to overpower Mr. Sholto and hold him while you were climbing the rope?\"\n",
      "\"You seem to know as much about it as if you were there, sir. The truth is that I hoped to find the room clear. I knew the habits of the house pretty well, and it was the time when Mr. Sholto usually went down to his supper. I shall make no secret of the business. The best defence that I can make is just the simple truth. Now, if it had been the old major I would have swung for him with a light heart. I would have thought no more of knifing him than of smoking this cigar. But it's cursed hard that I should be lagged over this young Sholto, with whom I had no quarrel whatever.\"\n",
      "\"You are under the charge of Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard. He is going to bring you up to my rooms, and I shall ask you for a true account of the matter. You must make a clean breast of it, for if you do I hope that I may be of use to you. I think I can prove that the poison acts so quickly that the man was dead before ever you reached the room.\"\n",
      "\"That he was, sir. I never got such a turn in my life as when I saw him grinning at me with his head on his shoulder as I climbed through the window. It fairly shook me, sir. I'd have half killed Tonga for it if he had not scrambled off. That was how he came to leave his club, and some of his darts too, as he tells me, which I dare say helped to put you on our track; though how you kept on it is more than I can tell. I don't feel no malice against you for it. But it does seem a queer thing,\" he added, with a bitter smile, \"that I who have a fair claim to nigh upon half a million of money should spend the first half of my life building a breakwater in the Andamans, and am like to spend the other half digging drains at Dartmoor. It was an evil day for me when first I clapped eyes upon the merchant Achmet and had to do with the Agra treasure, which never brought anything but a curse yet upon the man who owned it. To him it brought murder, to Major Sholto it brought fear and guilt, to me it has meant slavery for life.\"\n",
      "At this moment Athelney Jones thrust his broad face and heavy shoulders into the tiny cabin.\n",
      "\"Quite a family party,\" he remarked.\n",
      "\"I think I shall have a pull at that flask, Holmes. Well, I think we may all congratulate each other. Pity we didn't take the other alive; but there was no choice. I say, Holmes, you must confess that you cut it rather fine. It was all we could do to overhaul her.\"\n",
      "\"All is well that ends well,\" said Holmes.\n",
      "\"But I certainly did not know that the Aurora was such a clipper.\"\n",
      "\"Smith says she is one of the fastest launches on the river, and that if he had had another man to help him with the engines we should never have caught her. He swears he knew nothing of this Norwood business.\"\n",
      "\"Neither he did,\" cried our prisoner,--\"not a word. I chose his launch because I heard that she was a flier. We told him nothing, but we paid him well, and he was to get something handsome if we reached our vessel, the Esmeralda, at Gravesend, outward bound for the Brazils.\"\n",
      "\"Well, if he has done no wrong we shall see that no wrong comes to him. If we are pretty quick in catching our men, we are not so quick in condemning them.\"\n",
      "It was amusing to notice how the consequential Jones was already beginning to give himself airs on the strength of the capture.\n",
      "From the slight smile which played over Sherlock Holmes's face, I could see that the speech had not been lost upon him.\n",
      "\"We will be at Vauxhall Bridge presently,\" said Jones, \"and shall land you, Dr. Watson, with the treasure-box. I need hardly tell you that I am taking a very grave responsibility upon myself in doing this. It is most irregular; but of course an agreement is an agreement. I must, however, as a matter of duty, send an inspector with you, since you have so valuable a charge. You will drive, no doubt?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, I shall drive.\"\n",
      "\"It is a pity there is no key, that we may make an inventory first. You will have to break it open. Where is the key, my man?\"\n",
      "\"At the bottom of the river,\" said Small, shortly.\n",
      "\"Hum! There was no use your giving this unnecessary trouble. We have had work enough already through you. However, doctor, I need not warn you to be careful. Bring the box back with you to the Baker Street rooms. You will find us there, on our way to the station.\"\n",
      "They landed me at Vauxhall, with my heavy iron box, and with a bluff, genial inspector as my companion.\n",
      "A quarter of an hour's drive brought us to Mrs. Cecil Forrester's.\n",
      "The servant seemed surprised at so late a visitor.\n",
      "Mrs. Cecil Forrester was out for the evening, she explained, and likely to be very late.\n",
      "Miss Morstan, however, was in the drawing-room: so to the drawing-room I went, box in hand, leaving the obliging inspector in the cab.\n",
      "She was seated by the open window, dressed in some sort of white diaphanous material, with a little touch of scarlet at the neck and waist.\n",
      "The soft light of a shaded lamp fell upon her as she leaned back in the basket chair, playing over her sweet, grave face, and tinting with a dull, metallic sparkle the rich coils of her luxuriant hair.\n",
      "One white arm and hand drooped over the side of the chair, and her whole pose and figure spoke of an absorbing melancholy.\n",
      "At the sound of my foot-fall she sprang to her feet, however, and a bright flush of surprise and of pleasure colored her pale cheeks.\n",
      "\"I heard a cab drive up,\" she said.\n",
      "\"I thought that Mrs. Forrester had come back very early, but I never dreamed that it might be you. What news have you brought me?\"\n",
      "\"I have brought something better than news,\" said I, putting down the box upon the table and speaking jovially and boisterously, though my heart was heavy within me.\n",
      "\"I have brought you something which is worth all the news in the world. I have brought you a fortune.\"\n",
      "She glanced at iron box.\n",
      "\"Is that the treasure, then?\" she asked, coolly enough.\n",
      "\"Yes, this is the great Agra treasure. Half of it is yours and half is Thaddeus Sholto's. You will have a couple of hundred thousand each. Think of that! An annuity of ten thousand pounds. There will be few richer young ladies in England. Is it not glorious?\"\n",
      "I think that I must have been rather overacting my delight, and that she detected a hollow ring in my congratulations, for I saw her eyebrows rise a little, and she glanced at me curiously.\n",
      "\"If I have it,\" said she, \"I owe it to you.\"\n",
      "\"No, no,\" I answered, \"not to me, but to my friend Sherlock Holmes. With all the will in the world, I could never have followed up a clue which has taxed even his analytical genius. As it was, we very nearly lost it at the last moment.\"\n",
      "\"Pray sit down and tell me all about it, Dr. Watson,\" said she.\n",
      "I narrated briefly what had occurred since I had seen her last,--Holmes's new method of search, the discovery of the Aurora, the appearance of Athelney Jones, our expedition in the evening, and the wild chase down the Thames.\n",
      "She listened with parted lips and shining eyes to my recital of our adventures.\n",
      "When I spoke of the dart which had so narrowly missed us, she turned so white that I feared that she was about to faint.\n",
      "\"It is nothing,\" she said, as I hastened to pour her out some water.\n",
      "\"I am all right again. It was a shock to me to hear that I had placed my friends in such horrible peril.\"\n",
      "\"That is all over,\" I answered.\n",
      "\"It was nothing. I will tell you no more gloomy details. Let us turn to something brighter. There is the treasure. What could be brighter than that? I got leave to bring it with me, thinking that it would interest you to be the first to see it.\"\n",
      "\"It would be of the greatest interest to me,\" she said.\n",
      "There was no eagerness in her voice, however.\n",
      "It had struck her, doubtless, that it might seem ungracious upon her part to be indifferent to a prize which had cost so much to win.\n",
      "\"What a pretty box!\" she said, stooping over it.\n",
      "\"This is Indian work, I suppose?\"\n",
      "\"Yes; it is Benares metal-work.\"\n",
      "\"And so heavy!\" she exclaimed, trying to raise it.\n",
      "\"The box alone must be of some value. Where is the key?\"\n",
      "\"Small threw it into the Thames,\" I answered.\n",
      "\"I must borrow Mrs. Forrester's poker.\"\n",
      "There was in the front a thick and broad hasp, wrought in the image of a sitting Buddha.\n",
      "Under this I thrust the end of the poker and twisted it outward as a lever.\n",
      "The hasp sprang open with a loud snap.\n",
      "With trembling fingers I flung back the lid.\n",
      "We both stood gazing in astonishment.\n",
      "The box was empty!\n",
      "No wonder that it was heavy.\n",
      "The iron-work was two-thirds of an inch thick all round.\n",
      "It was massive, well made, and solid, like a chest constructed to carry things of great price, but not one shred or crumb of metal or jewelry lay within it.\n",
      "It was absolutely and completely empty.\n",
      "\"The treasure is lost,\" said Miss Morstan, calmly.\n",
      "As I listened to the words and realized what they meant, a great shadow seemed to pass from my soul.\n",
      "I did not know how this Agra treasure had weighed me down, until now that it was finally removed.\n",
      "It was selfish, no doubt, disloyal, wrong, but I could realize nothing save that the golden barrier was gone from between us.\n",
      "\"Thank God!\"\n",
      "I ejaculated from my very heart.\n",
      "She looked at me with a quick, questioning smile.\n",
      "\"Why do you say that?\" she asked.\n",
      "\"Because you are within my reach again,\" I said, taking her hand.\n",
      "She did not withdraw it.\n",
      "\"Because I love you, Mary, as truly as ever a man loved a woman. Because this treasure, these riches, sealed my lips. Now that they are gone I can tell you how I love you. That is why I said, 'Thank God.'\"\n",
      "\"Then I say, 'Thank God,' too,\" she whispered, as I drew her to my side.\n",
      "Whoever had lost a treasure, I knew that night that I had gained one.\n",
      "CHAPTER XII The Strange Story of Jonathan Small\n",
      "A very patient man was that inspector in the cab, for it was a weary time before I rejoined him.\n",
      "His face clouded over when I showed him the empty box.\n",
      "\"There goes the reward!\" said he, gloomily.\n",
      "\"Where there is no money there is no pay. This night's work would have been worth a tenner each to Sam Brown and me if the treasure had been there.\"\n",
      "\"Mr. Thaddeus Sholto is a rich man,\" I said.\n",
      "\"He will see that you are rewarded, treasure or no.\"\n",
      "The inspector shook his head despondently, however.\n",
      "\"It's a bad job,\" he repeated; \"and so Mr. Athelney Jones will think.\"\n",
      "His forecast proved to be correct, for the detective looked blank enough when I got to Baker Street and showed him the empty box.\n",
      "They had only just arrived, Holmes, the prisoner, and he, for they had changed their plans so far as to report themselves at a station upon the way.\n",
      "My companion lounged in his arm-chair with his usual listless expression, while Small sat stolidly opposite to him with his wooden leg cocked over his sound one.\n",
      "As I exhibited the empty box he leaned back in his chair and laughed aloud.\n",
      "\"This is your doing, Small,\" said Athelney Jones, angrily.\n",
      "\"Yes, I have put it away where you shall never lay hand upon it,\" he cried, exultantly.\n",
      "\"It is my treasure; and if I can't have the loot I'll take darned good care that no one else does. I tell you that no living man has any right to it, unless it is three men who are in the Andaman convict-barracks and myself. I know now that I cannot have the use of it, and I know that they cannot. I have acted all through for them as much as for myself. It's been the sign of four with us always. Well I know that they would have had me do just what I have done, and throw the treasure into the Thames rather than let it go to kith or kin of Sholto or of Morstan. It was not to make them rich that we did for Achmet. You'll find the treasure where the key is, and where little Tonga is. When I saw that your launch must catch us, I put the loot away in a safe place. There are no rupees for you this journey.\"\n",
      "\"You are deceiving us, Small,\" said Athelney Jones, sternly.\n",
      "\"If you had wished to throw the treasure into the Thames it would have been easier for you to have thrown box and all.\"\n",
      "\"Easier for me to throw, and easier for you to recover,\" he answered, with a shrewd, sidelong look.\n",
      "\"The man that was clever enough to hunt me down is clever enough to pick an iron box from the bottom of a river. Now that they are scattered over five miles or so, it may be a harder job. It went to my heart to do it, though. I was half mad when you came up with us. However, there's no good grieving over it. I've had ups in my life, and I've had downs, but I've learned not to cry over spilled milk.\"\n",
      "\"This is a very serious matter, Small,\" said the detective.\n",
      "\"If you had helped justice, instead of thwarting it in this way, you would have had a better chance at your trial.\"\n",
      "\"Justice!\" snarled the ex-convict.\n",
      "\"A pretty justice! Whose loot is this, if it is not ours? Where is the justice that I should give it up to those who have never earned it? Look how I have earned it! Twenty long years in that fever-ridden swamp, all day at work under the mangrove-tree, all night chained up in the filthy convict-huts, bitten by mosquitoes, racked with ague, bullied by every cursed black-faced policeman who loved to take it out of a white man. That was how I earned the Agra treasure; and you talk to me of justice because I cannot bear to feel that I have paid this price only that another may enjoy it! I would rather swing a score of times, or have one of Tonga's darts in my hide, than live in a convict's cell and feel that another man is at his ease in a palace with the money that should be mine.\"\n",
      "Small had dropped his mask of stoicism, and all this came out in a wild whirl of words, while his eyes blazed, and the handcuffs clanked together with the impassioned movement of his hands.\n",
      "I could understand, as I saw the fury and the passion of the man, that it was no groundless or unnatural terror which had possessed Major Sholto when he first learned that the injured convict was upon his track.\n",
      "\"You forget that we know nothing of all this,\" said Holmes quietly.\n",
      "\"We have not heard your story, and we cannot tell how far justice may originally have been on your side.\"\n",
      "\"Well, sir, you have been very fair-spoken to me, though I can see that I have you to thank that I have these bracelets upon my wrists.\n",
      "Still, I bear no grudge for that.\n",
      "It is all fair and above-board.\n",
      "If you want to hear my story I have no wish to hold it back.\n",
      "What I say to you is God's truth, every word of it.\n",
      "Thank you; you can put the glass beside me here, and I'll put my lips to it if I am dry.\n",
      "\"I am a Worcestershire man myself,--born near Pershore.\n",
      "I dare say you would find a heap of Smalls living there now if you were to look.\n",
      "I have often thought of taking a look round there, but the truth is that I was never much of a credit to the family, and I doubt if they would be so very glad to see me.\n",
      "They were all steady, chapel-going folk, small farmers, well known and respected over the country-side, while I was always a bit of a rover.\n",
      "At last, however, when I was about eighteen, I gave them no more trouble, for I got into a mess over a girl, and could only get out of it again by taking the queen's shilling and joining the 3d Buffs, which was just starting for India.\n",
      "\"I wasn't destined to do much soldiering, however.\n",
      "I had just got past the goose-step, and learned to handle my musket, when I was fool enough to go swimming in the Ganges.\n",
      "Luckily for me, my company sergeant, John Holder, was in the water at the same time, and he was one of the finest swimmers in the service.\n",
      "A crocodile took me, just as I was half-way across, and nipped off my right leg as clean as a surgeon could have done it, just above the knee.\n",
      "What with the shock and the loss of blood, I fainted, and should have drowned if Holder had not caught hold of me and paddled for the bank.\n",
      "I was five months in hospital over it, and when at last I was able to limp out of it with this timber toe strapped to my stump I found myself invalided out of the army and unfitted for any active occupation.\n",
      "\"I was, as you can imagine, pretty down on my luck at this time, for I was a useless cripple though not yet in my twentieth year.\n",
      "However, my misfortune soon proved to be a blessing in disguise.\n",
      "A man named Abelwhite, who had come out there as an indigo-planter, wanted an overseer to look after his coolies and keep them up to their work.\n",
      "He happened to be a friend of our colonel's, who had taken an interest in me since the accident.\n",
      "To make a long story short, the colonel recommended me strongly for the post and, as the work was mostly to be done on horseback, my leg was no great obstacle, for I had enough knee left to keep good grip on the saddle.\n",
      "What I had to do was to ride over the plantation, to keep an eye on the men as they worked, and to report the idlers.\n",
      "The pay was fair, I had comfortable quarters, and altogether I was content to spend the remainder of my life in indigo-planting.\n",
      "Mr. Abelwhite was a kind man, and he would often drop into my little shanty and smoke a pipe with me, for white folk out there feel their hearts warm to each other as they never do here at home.\n",
      "\"Well, I was never in luck's way long.\n",
      "Suddenly, without a note of warning, the great mutiny broke upon us.\n",
      "One month India lay as still and peaceful, to all appearance, as Surrey or Kent; the next there were two hundred thousand black devils let loose, and the country was a perfect hell.\n",
      "Of course you know all about it, gentlemen,--a deal more than I do, very like, since reading is not in my line.\n",
      "I only know what I saw with my own eyes.\n",
      "Our plantation was at a place called Muttra, near the border of the Northwest Provinces.\n",
      "Night after night the whole sky was alight with the burning bungalows, and day after day we had small companies of Europeans passing through our estate with their wives and children, on their way to Agra, where were the nearest troops.\n",
      "Mr. Abelwhite was an obstinate man.\n",
      "He had it in his head that the affair had been exaggerated, and that it would blow over as suddenly as it had sprung up.\n",
      "There he sat on his veranda, drinking whiskey-pegs and smoking cheroots, while the country was in a blaze about him.\n",
      "Of course we stuck by him, I and Dawson, who, with his wife, used to do the book-work and the managing.\n",
      "Well, one fine day the crash came.\n",
      "I had been away on a distant plantation, and was riding slowly home in the evening, when my eye fell upon something all huddled together at the bottom of a steep nullah.\n",
      "I rode down to see what it was, and the cold struck through my heart when I found it was Dawson's wife, all cut into ribbons, and half eaten by jackals and native dogs.\n",
      "A little further up the road Dawson himself was lying on his face, quite dead, with an empty revolver in his hand and four Sepoys lying across each other in front of him.\n",
      "I reined up my horse, wondering which way I should turn, but at that moment I saw thick smoke curling up from Abelwhite's bungalow and the flames beginning to burst through the roof.\n",
      "I knew then that I could do my employer no good, but would only throw my own life away if I meddled in the matter.\n",
      "From where I stood I could see hundreds of the black fiends, with their red coats still on their backs, dancing and howling round the burning house.\n",
      "Some of them pointed at me, and a couple of bullets sang past my head; so I broke away across the paddy-fields, and found myself late at night safe within the walls at Agra.\n",
      "\"As it proved, however, there was no great safety there, either.\n",
      "The whole country was up like a swarm of bees.\n",
      "Wherever the English could collect in little bands they held just the ground that their guns commanded.\n",
      "Everywhere else they were helpless fugitives.\n",
      "It was a fight of the millions against the hundreds; and the cruellest part of it was that these men that we fought against, foot, horse, and gunners, were our own picked troops, whom we had taught and trained, handling our own weapons, and blowing our own bugle-calls.\n",
      "At Agra there were the 3d Bengal Fusiliers, some Sikhs, two troops of horse, and a battery of artillery.\n",
      "A volunteer corps of clerks and merchants had been formed, and this I joined, wooden leg and all.\n",
      "We went out to meet the rebels at Shahgunge early in July, and we beat them back for a time, but our powder gave out, and we had to fall back upon the city.\n",
      "Nothing but the worst news came to us from every side,--which is not to be wondered at, for if you look at the map you will see that we were right in the heart of it.\n",
      "Lucknow is rather better than a hundred miles to the east, and Cawnpore about as far to the south.\n",
      "From every point on the compass there was nothing but torture and murder and outrage.\n",
      "\"The city of Agra is a great place, swarming with fanatics and fierce devil-worshippers of all sorts.\n",
      "Our handful of men were lost among the narrow, winding streets.\n",
      "Our leader moved across the river, therefore, and took up his position in the old fort at Agra.\n",
      "I don't know if any of you gentlemen have ever read or heard anything of that old fort.\n",
      "It is a very queer place,--the queerest that ever I was in, and I have been in some rum corners, too.\n",
      "First of all, it is enormous in size.\n",
      "I should think that the enclosure must be acres and acres.\n",
      "There is a modern part, which took all our garrison, women, children, stores, and everything else, with plenty of room over.\n",
      "But the modern part is nothing like the size of the old quarter, where nobody goes, and which is given over to the scorpions and the centipedes.\n",
      "It is all full of great deserted halls, and winding passages, and long corridors twisting in and out, so that it is easy enough for folk to get lost in it.\n",
      "For this reason it was seldom that any one went into it, though now and again a party with torches might go exploring.\n",
      "\"The river washes along the front of the old fort, and so protects it, but on the sides and behind there are many doors, and these had to be guarded, of course, in the old quarter as well as in that which was actually held by our troops.\n",
      "We were short-handed, with hardly men enough to man the angles of the building and to serve the guns.\n",
      "It was impossible for us, therefore, to station a strong guard at every one of the innumerable gates.\n",
      "What we did was to organize a central guard-house in the middle of the fort, and to leave each gate under the charge of one white man and two or three natives.\n",
      "I was selected to take charge during certain hours of the night of a small isolated door upon the southwest side of the building.\n",
      "Two Sikh troopers were placed under my command, and I was instructed if anything went wrong to fire my musket, when I might rely upon help coming at once from the central guard.\n",
      "As the guard was a good two hundred paces away, however, and as the space between was cut up into a labyrinth of passages and corridors, I had great doubts as to whether they could arrive in time to be of any use in case of an actual attack.\n",
      "\"Well, I was pretty proud at having this small command given me, since I was a raw recruit, and a game-legged one at that.\n",
      "For two nights I kept the watch with my Punjaubees.\n",
      "They were tall, fierce-looking chaps, Mahomet Singh and Abdullah Khan by name, both old fighting-men who had borne arms against us at Chilian-wallah.\n",
      "They could talk English pretty well, but I could get little out of them.\n",
      "They preferred to stand together and jabber all night in their queer Sikh lingo.\n",
      "For myself, I used to stand outside the gate-way, looking down on the broad, winding river and on the twinkling lights of the great city.\n",
      "The beating of drums, the rattle of tomtoms, and the yells and howls of the rebels, drunk with opium and with bang, were enough to remind us all night of our dangerous neighbors across the stream.\n",
      "Every two hours the officer of the night used to come round to all the posts, to make sure that all was well.\n",
      "\"The third night of my watch was dark and dirty, with a small, driving rain.\n",
      "It was dreary work standing in the gate-way hour after hour in such weather.\n",
      "I tried again and again to make my Sikhs talk, but without much success.\n",
      "At two in the morning the rounds passed, and broke for a moment the weariness of the night.\n",
      "Finding that my companions would not be led into conversation, I took out my pipe, and laid down my musket to strike the match.\n",
      "In an instant the two Sikhs were upon me.\n",
      "One of them snatched my firelock up and levelled it at my head, while the other held a great knife to my throat and swore between his teeth that he would plunge it into me if I moved a step.\n",
      "\"My first thought was that these fellows were in league with the rebels, and that this was the beginning of an assault.\n",
      "If our door were in the hands of the Sepoys the place must fall, and the women and children be treated as they were in Cawnpore.\n",
      "Maybe you gentlemen think that I am just making out a case for myself, but I give you my word that when I thought of that, though I felt the point of the knife at my throat, I opened my mouth with the intention of giving a scream, if it was my last one, which might alarm the main guard.\n",
      "The man who held me seemed to know my thoughts; for, even as I braced myself to it, he whispered, 'Don't make a noise. The fort is safe enough. There are no rebel dogs on this side of the river.'\n",
      "There was the ring of truth in what he said, and I knew that if I raised my voice I was a dead man. I could read it in the fellow's brown eyes.\n",
      "I waited, therefore, in silence, to see what it was that they wanted from me.\n",
      "\"'Listen to me, Sahib,' said the taller and fiercer of the pair, the one whom they called Abdullah Khan.\n",
      "'You must either be with us now or you must be silenced forever. The thing is too great a one for us to hesitate. Either you are heart and soul with us on your oath on the cross of the Christians, or your body this night shall be thrown into the ditch and we shall pass over to our brothers in the rebel army. There is no middle way. Which is it to be, death or life? We can only give you three minutes to decide, for the time is passing, and all must be done before the rounds come again.'\n",
      "\"'How can I decide?' said I. 'You have not told me what you want of me. But I tell you now that if it is anything against the safety of the fort I will have no truck with it, so you can drive home your knife and welcome.'\n",
      "\"'It is nothing against the fort,' said he.\n",
      "'We only ask you to do that which your countrymen come to this land for. We ask you to be rich. If you will be one of us this night, we will swear to you upon the naked knife, and by the threefold oath which no Sikh was ever known to break, that you shall have your fair share of the loot. A quarter of the treasure shall be yours. We can say no fairer.'\n",
      "\"'But what is the treasure, then?'\n",
      "I asked.\n",
      "'I am as ready to be rich as you can be, if you will but show me how it can be done.'\n",
      "\"'You will swear, then,' said he, 'by the bones of your father, by the honor of your mother, by the cross of your faith, to raise no hand and speak no word against us, either now or afterwards?'\n",
      "\"'I will swear it,' I answered, 'provided that the fort is not endangered.'\n",
      "\"'Then my comrade and I will swear that you shall have a quarter of the treasure which shall be equally divided among the four of us.'\n",
      "\"'There are but three,' said I.\n",
      "\"'No; Dost Akbar must have his share.\n",
      "We can tell the tale to you while we await them.\n",
      "Do you stand at the gate, Mahomet Singh, and give notice of their coming.\n",
      "The thing stands thus, Sahib, and I tell it to you because I know that an oath is binding upon a Feringhee, and that we may trust you.\n",
      "Had you been a lying Hindoo, though you had sworn by all the gods in their false temples, your blood would have been upon the knife, and your body in the water.\n",
      "But the Sikh knows the Englishman, and the Englishman knows the Sikh.\n",
      "Hearken, then, to what I have to say.\n",
      "\"'There is a rajah in the northern provinces who has much wealth, though his lands are small.\n",
      "Much has come to him from his father, and more still he has set by himself, for he is of a low nature and hoards his gold rather than spend it.\n",
      "When the troubles broke out he would be friends both with the lion and the tiger,--with the Sepoy and with the Company's raj.\n",
      "Soon, however, it seemed to him that the white men's day was come, for through all the land he could hear of nothing but of their death and their overthrow.\n",
      "Yet, being a careful man, he made such plans that, come what might, half at least of his treasure should be left to him.\n",
      "That which was in gold and silver he kept by him in the vaults of his palace, but the most precious stones and the choicest pearls that he had he put in an iron box, and sent it by a trusty servant who, under the guise of a merchant, should take it to the fort at Agra, there to lie until the land is at peace.\n",
      "Thus, if the rebels won he would have his money, but if the Company conquered his jewels would be saved to him.\n",
      "Having thus divided his hoard, he threw himself into the cause of the Sepoys, since they were strong upon his borders.\n",
      "By doing this, mark you, Sahib, his property becomes the due of those who have been true to their salt.\n",
      "\"'This pretended merchant, who travels under the name of Achmet, is now in the city of Agra, and desires to gain his way into the fort.\n",
      "He has with him as travelling-companion my foster-brother Dost Akbar, who knows his secret.\n",
      "Dost Akbar has promised this night to lead him to a side-postern of the fort, and has chosen this one for his purpose.\n",
      "Here he will come presently, and here he will find Mahomet Singh and myself awaiting him.\n",
      "The place is lonely, and none shall know of his coming.\n",
      "The world shall know of the merchant Achmet no more, but the great treasure of the rajah shall be divided among us.\n",
      "What say you to it, Sahib?'\n",
      "\"In Worcestershire the life of a man seems a great and a sacred thing; but it is very different when there is fire and blood all round you and you have been used to meeting death at every turn.\n",
      "Whether Achmet the merchant lived or died was a thing as light as air to me, but at the talk about the treasure my heart turned to it, and I thought of what I might do in the old country with it, and how my folk would stare when they saw their ne'er-do-well coming back with his pockets full of gold moidores.\n",
      "I had, therefore, already made up my mind.\n",
      "Abdullah Khan, however, thinking that I hesitated, pressed the matter more closely.\n",
      "\"'Consider, Sahib,' said he, 'that if this man is taken by the commandant he will be hung or shot, and his jewels taken by the government, so that no man will be a rupee the better for them. Now, since we do the taking of him, why should we not do the rest as well? The jewels will be as well with us as in the Company's coffers. There will be enough to make every one of us rich men and great chiefs. No one can know about the matter, for here we are cut off from all men. What could be better for the purpose? Say again, then, Sahib, whether you are with us, or if we must look upon you as an enemy.'\n",
      "\"'I am with you heart and soul,' said I.\n",
      "\"'It is well,' he answered, handing me back my firelock.\n",
      "'You see that we trust you, for your word, like ours, is not to be broken. We have now only to wait for my brother and the merchant.'\n",
      "\"'Does your brother know, then, of what you will do?'\n",
      "I asked.\n",
      "\"'The plan is his.\n",
      "He has devised it.\n",
      "We will go to the gate and share the watch with Mahomet Singh.'\n",
      "\"The rain was still falling steadily, for it was just the beginning of the wet season.\n",
      "Brown, heavy clouds were drifting across the sky, and it was hard to see more than a stone-cast.\n",
      "A deep moat lay in front of our door, but the water was in places nearly dried up, and it could easily be crossed.\n",
      "It was strange to me to be standing there with those two wild Punjaubees waiting for the man who was coming to his death.\n",
      "\"Suddenly my eye caught the glint of a shaded lantern at the other side of the moat.\n",
      "It vanished among the mound-heaps, and then appeared again coming slowly in our direction.\n",
      "\"'Here they are!'\n",
      "I exclaimed.\n",
      "\"'You will challenge him, Sahib, as usual,' whispered Abdullah.\n",
      "'Give him no cause for fear. Send us in with him, and we shall do the rest while you stay here on guard. Have the lantern ready to uncover, that we may be sure that it is indeed the man.'\n",
      "\"The light had flickered onwards, now stopping and now advancing, until I could see two dark figures upon the other side of the moat.\n",
      "I let them scramble down the sloping bank, splash through the mire, and climb half-way up to the gate, before I challenged them.\n",
      "\"'Who goes there?' said I, in a subdued voice.\n",
      "\"'Friends,' came the answer.\n",
      "I uncovered my lantern and threw a flood of light upon them.\n",
      "The first was an enormous Sikh, with a black beard which swept nearly down to his cummerbund.\n",
      "Outside of a show I have never seen so tall a man.\n",
      "The other was a little, fat, round fellow, with a great yellow turban, and a bundle in his hand, done up in a shawl.\n",
      "He seemed to be all in a quiver with fear, for his hands twitched as if he had the ague, and his head kept turning to left and right with two bright little twinkling eyes, like a mouse when he ventures out from his hole.\n",
      "It gave me the chills to think of killing him, but I thought of the treasure, and my heart set as hard as a flint within me.\n",
      "When he saw my white face he gave a little chirrup of joy and came running up towards me.\n",
      "\"'Your protection, Sahib,' he panted,--'your protection for the unhappy merchant Achmet. I have travelled across Rajpootana that I might seek the shelter of the fort at Agra. I have been robbed and beaten and abused because I have been the friend of the Company. It is a blessed night this when I am once more in safety,--I and my poor possessions.'\n",
      "\"'What have you in the bundle?'\n",
      "I asked.\n",
      "\"'An iron box,' he answered, 'which contains one or two little family matters which are of no value to others, but which I should be sorry to lose. Yet I am not a beggar; and I shall reward you, young Sahib, and your governor also, if he will give me the shelter I ask.'\n",
      "\"I could not trust myself to speak longer with the man.\n",
      "The more I looked at his fat, frightened face, the harder did it seem that we should slay him in cold blood.\n",
      "It was best to get it over.\n",
      "\"'Take him to the main guard,' said I.\n",
      "The two Sikhs closed in upon him on each side, and the giant walked behind, while they marched in through the dark gate-way.\n",
      "Never was a man so compassed round with death.\n",
      "I remained at the gate-way with the lantern.\n",
      "\"I could hear the measured tramp of their footsteps sounding through the lonely corridors. Suddenly it ceased, and I heard voices, and a scuffle, with the sound of blows. A moment later there came, to my horror, a rush of footsteps coming in my direction, with the loud breathing of a running man. I turned my lantern down the long, straight passage, and there was the fat man, running like the wind, with a smear of blood across his face, and close at his heels, bounding like a tiger, the great black-bearded Sikh, with a knife flashing in his hand. I have never seen a man run so fast as that little merchant. He was gaining on the Sikh, and I could see that if he once passed me and got to the open air he would save himself yet. My heart softened to him, but again the thought of his treasure turned me hard and bitter. I cast my firelock between his legs as he raced past, and he rolled twice over like a shot rabbit. Ere he could stagger to his feet the Sikh was upon him, and buried his knife twice in his side. The man never uttered moan nor moved muscle, but lay were he had fallen. I think myself that he may have broken his neck with the fall. You see, gentlemen, that I am keeping my promise. I am telling you every work of the business just exactly as it happened, whether it is in my favor or not.\"\n",
      "He stopped, and held out his manacled hands for the whiskey-and-water which Holmes had brewed for him.\n",
      "For myself, I confess that I had now conceived the utmost horror of the man, not only for this cold-blooded business in which he had been concerned, but even more for the somewhat flippant and careless way in which he narrated it.\n",
      "Whatever punishment was in store for him, I felt that he might expect no sympathy from me.\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes and Jones sat with their hands upon their knees, deeply interested in the story, but with the same disgust written upon their faces.\n",
      "He may have observed it, for there was a touch of defiance in his voice and manner as he proceeded.\n",
      "\"It was all very bad, no doubt,\" said he.\n",
      "\"I should like to know how many fellows in my shoes would have refused a share of this loot when they knew that they would have their throats cut for their pains. Besides, it was my life or his when once he was in the fort. If he had got out, the whole business would come to light, and I should have been court-martialled and shot as likely as not; for people were not very lenient at a time like that.\"\n",
      "\"Go on with your story,\" said Holmes, shortly.\n",
      "\"Well, we carried him in, Abdullah, Akbar, and I.\n",
      "A fine weight he was, too, for all that he was so short.\n",
      "Mahomet Singh was left to guard the door.\n",
      "We took him to a place which the Sikhs had already prepared.\n",
      "It was some distance off, where a winding passage leads to a great empty hall, the brick walls of which were all crumbling to pieces.\n",
      "The earth floor had sunk in at one place, making a natural grave, so we left Achmet the merchant there, having first covered him over with loose bricks.\n",
      "This done, we all went back to the treasure.\n",
      "\"It lay where he had dropped it when he was first attacked.\n",
      "The box was the same which now lies open upon your table.\n",
      "A key was hung by a silken cord to that carved handle upon the top.\n",
      "We opened it, and the light of the lantern gleamed upon a collection of gems such as I have read of and thought about when I was a little lad at Pershore.\n",
      "It was blinding to look upon them.\n",
      "When we had feasted our eyes we took them all out and made a list of them.\n",
      "There were one hundred and forty-three diamonds of the first water, including one which has been called, I believe, 'the Great Mogul' and is said to be the second largest stone in existence.\n",
      "Then there were ninety-seven very fine emeralds, and one hundred and seventy rubies, some of which, however, were small.\n",
      "There were forty carbuncles, two hundred and ten sapphires, sixty-one agates, and a great quantity of beryls, onyxes, cats'-eyes, turquoises, and other stones, the very names of which I did not know at the time, though I have become more familiar with them since.\n",
      "Besides this, there were nearly three hundred very fine pearls, twelve of which were set in a gold coronet.\n",
      "By the way, these last had been taken out of the chest and were not there when I recovered it.\n",
      "\"After we had counted our treasures we put them back into the chest and carried them to the gate-way to show them to Mahomet Singh.\n",
      "Then we solemnly renewed our oath to stand by each other and be true to our secret.\n",
      "We agreed to conceal our loot in a safe place until the country should be at peace again, and then to divide it equally among ourselves.\n",
      "There was no use dividing it at present, for if gems of such value were found upon us it would cause suspicion, and there was no privacy in the fort nor any place where we could keep them.\n",
      "We carried the box, therefore, into the same hall where we had buried the body, and there, under certain bricks in the best-preserved wall, we made a hollow and put our treasure.\n",
      "We made careful note of the place, and next day I drew four plans, one for each of us, and put the sign of the four of us at the bottom, for we had sworn that we should each always act for all, so that none might take advantage.\n",
      "That is an oath that I can put my hand to my heart and swear that I have never broken.\n",
      "\"Well, there's no use my telling you gentlemen what came of the Indian mutiny.\n",
      "After Wilson took Delhi and Sir Colin relieved Lucknow the back of the business was broken.\n",
      "Fresh troops came pouring in, and Nana Sahib made himself scarce over the frontier.\n",
      "A flying column under Colonel Greathed came round to Agra and cleared the Pandies away from it.\n",
      "Peace seemed to be settling upon the country, and we four were beginning to hope that the time was at hand when we might safely go off with our shares of the plunder.\n",
      "In a moment, however, our hopes were shattered by our being arrested as the murderers of Achmet.\n",
      "\"It came about in this way.\n",
      "When the rajah put his jewels into the hands of Achmet he did it because he knew that he was a trusty man.\n",
      "They are suspicious folk in the East, however: so what does this rajah do but take a second even more trusty servant and set him to play the spy upon the first?\n",
      "This second man was ordered never to let Achmet out of his sight, and he followed him like his shadow.\n",
      "He went after him that night and saw him pass through the doorway.\n",
      "Of course he thought he had taken refuge in the fort, and applied for admission there himself next day, but could find no trace of Achmet.\n",
      "This seemed to him so strange that he spoke about it to a sergeant of guides, who brought it to the ears of the commandant.\n",
      "A thorough search was quickly made, and the body was discovered.\n",
      "Thus at the very moment that we thought that all was safe we were all four seized and brought to trial on a charge of murder,--three of us because we had held the gate that night, and the fourth because he was known to have been in the company of the murdered man.\n",
      "Not a word about the jewels came out at the trial, for the rajah had been deposed and driven out of India: so no one had any particular interest in them.\n",
      "The murder, however, was clearly made out, and it was certain that we must all have been concerned in it.\n",
      "The three Sikhs got penal servitude for life, and I was condemned to death, though my sentence was afterwards commuted into the same as the others.\n",
      "\"It was rather a queer position that we found ourselves in then.\n",
      "There we were all four tied by the leg and with precious little chance of ever getting out again, while we each held a secret which might have put each of us in a palace if we could only have made use of it.\n",
      "It was enough to make a man eat his heart out to have to stand the kick and the cuff of every petty jack-in-office, to have rice to eat and water to drink, when that gorgeous fortune was ready for him outside, just waiting to be picked up.\n",
      "It might have driven me mad; but I was always a pretty stubborn one, so I just held on and bided my time.\n",
      "\"At last it seemed to me to have come.\n",
      "I was changed from Agra to Madras, and from there to Blair Island in the Andamans.\n",
      "There are very few white convicts at this settlement, and, as I had behaved well from the first, I soon found myself a sort of privileged person.\n",
      "I was given a hut in Hope Town, which is a small place on the slopes of Mount Harriet, and I was left pretty much to myself.\n",
      "It is a dreary, fever-stricken place, and all beyond our little clearings was infested with wild cannibal natives, who were ready enough to blow a poisoned dart at us if they saw a chance.\n",
      "There was digging, and ditching, and yam-planting, and a dozen other things to be done, so we were busy enough all day; though in the evening we had a little time to ourselves.\n",
      "Among other things, I learned to dispense drugs for the surgeon, and picked up a smattering of his knowledge.\n",
      "All the time I was on the lookout for a chance of escape; but it is hundreds of miles from any other land, and there is little or no wind in those seas: so it was a terribly difficult job to get away.\n",
      "\"The surgeon, Dr. Somerton, was a fast, sporting young chap, and the other young officers would meet in his rooms of an evening and play cards.\n",
      "The surgery, where I used to make up my drugs, was next to his sitting-room, with a small window between us.\n",
      "Often, if I felt lonesome, I used to turn out the lamp in the surgery, and then, standing there, I could hear their talk and watch their play.\n",
      "I am fond of a hand at cards myself, and it was almost as good as having one to watch the others.\n",
      "There was Major Sholto, Captain Morstan, and Lieutenant Bromley Brown, who were in command of the native troops, and there was the surgeon himself, and two or three prison-officials, crafty old hands who played a nice sly safe game.\n",
      "A very snug little party they used to make.\n",
      "\"Well, there was one thing which very soon struck me, and that was that the soldiers used always to lose and the civilians to win.\n",
      "Mind, I don't say that there was anything unfair, but so it was.\n",
      "These prison-chaps had done little else than play cards ever since they had been at the Andamans, and they knew each other's game to a point, while the others just played to pass the time and threw their cards down anyhow.\n",
      "Night after night the soldiers got up poorer men, and the poorer they got the more keen they were to play.\n",
      "Major Sholto was the hardest hit.\n",
      "He used to pay in notes and gold at first, but soon it came to notes of hand and for big sums.\n",
      "He sometimes would win for a few deals, just to give him heart, and then the luck would set in against him worse than ever.\n",
      "All day he would wander about as black as thunder, and he took to drinking a deal more than was good for him.\n",
      "\"One night he lost even more heavily than usual.\n",
      "I was sitting in my hut when he and Captain Morstan came stumbling along on the way to their quarters.\n",
      "They were bosom friends, those two, and never far apart.\n",
      "The major was raving about his losses.\n",
      "\"'It's all up, Morstan,' he was saying, as they passed my hut.\n",
      "'I shall have to send in my papers. I am a ruined man.'\n",
      "\"'Nonsense, old chap!' said the other, slapping him upon the shoulder.\n",
      "'I've had a nasty facer myself, but--'\n",
      "That was all I could hear, but it was enough to set me thinking.\n",
      "A couple of days later Major Sholto was strolling on the beach: so I took the chance of speaking to him.\n",
      "\"'I wish to have your advice, major,' said I.\n",
      "\"'Well, Small, what is it?' he asked, taking his cheroot from his lips.\n",
      "\"'I wanted to ask you, sir,' said I, 'who is the proper person to whom hidden treasure should be handed over. I know where half a million worth lies, and, as I cannot use it myself, I thought perhaps the best thing that I could do would be to hand it over to the proper authorities, and then perhaps they would get my sentence shortened for me.'\n",
      "\"'Half a million, Small?' he gasped, looking hard at me to see if I was in earnest.\n",
      "\"'Quite that, sir,--in jewels and pearls.\n",
      "It lies there ready for anyone.\n",
      "And the queer thing about it is that the real owner is outlawed and cannot hold property, so that it belongs to the first comer.'\n",
      "\"'To government, Small,' he stammered,--'to government.\n",
      "' But he said it in a halting fashion, and I knew in my heart that I had got him.\n",
      "\"'You think, then, sir, that I should give the information to the Governor-General?' said I, quietly.\n",
      "\"'Well, well, you must not do anything rash, or that you might repent.\n",
      "Let me hear all about it, Small.\n",
      "Give me the facts.'\n",
      "\"I told him the whole story, with small changes so that he could not identify the places.\n",
      "When I had finished he stood stock still and full of thought.\n",
      "I could see by the twitch of his lip that there was a struggle going on within him.\n",
      "\"'This is a very important matter, Small,' he said, at last.\n",
      "'You must not say a word to any one about it, and I shall see you again soon.'\n",
      "\"Two nights later he and his friend Captain Morstan came to my hut in the dead of the night with a lantern.\n",
      "\"'I want you just to let Captain Morstan hear that story from your own lips, Small,' said he.\n",
      "\"I repeated it as I had told it before.\n",
      "\"'It rings true, eh?' said he.\n",
      "'It's good enough to act upon?'\n",
      "\"Captain Morstan nodded.\n",
      "\"'Look here, Small,' said the major.\n",
      "'We have been talking it over, my friend here and I, and we have come to the conclusion that this secret of yours is hardly a government matter, after all, but is a private concern of your own, which of course you have the power of disposing of as you think best. Now, the question is, what price would you ask for it? We might be inclined to take it up, and at least look into it, if we could agree as to terms.'\n",
      "He tried to speak in a cool, careless way, but his eyes were shining with excitement and greed.\n",
      "\"'Why, as to that, gentlemen,' I answered, trying also to be cool, but feeling as excited as he did, 'there is only one bargain which a man in my position can make. I shall want you to help me to my freedom, and to help my three companions to theirs. We shall then take yo into partnership, and give you a fifth share to divide between you.'\n",
      "\"'Hum!' said he.\n",
      "'A fifth share! That is not very tempting.'\n",
      "\"'It would come to fifty thousand apiece,' said I.\n",
      "\"'But how can we gain your freedom?\n",
      "You know very well that you ask an impossibility.'\n",
      "\"'Nothing of the sort,' I answered.\n",
      "'I have thought it all out to the last detail. The only bar to our escape is that we can get no boat fit for the voyage, and no provisions to last us for so long a time. There are plenty of little yachts and yawls at Calcutta or Madras which would serve our turn well. Do you bring one over. We shall engage to get aboard her by night, and if you will drop us on any part of the Indian coast you will have done your part of the bargain.'\n",
      "\"'If there were only one,' he said.\n",
      "\"'None or all,' I answered.\n",
      "'We have sworn it. The four of us must always act together.'\n",
      "\"'You see, Morstan,' said he, 'Small is a man of his word. He does not flinch from his friend. I think we may very well trust him.'\n",
      "\"'It's a dirty business,' the other answered.\n",
      "'Yet, as you say, the money would save our commissions handsomely.'\n",
      "\"'Well, Small,' said the major, 'we must, I suppose, try and meet you. We must first, of course, test the truth of your story. Tell me where the box is hid, and I shall get leave of absence and go back to India in the monthly relief-boat to inquire into the affair.'\n",
      "\"'Not so fast,' said I, growing colder as he got hot.\n",
      "'I must have the consent of my three comrades. I tell you that it is four or none with us.'\n",
      "\"'Nonsense!' he broke in.\n",
      "'What have three black fellows to do with our agreement?'\n",
      "\"'Black or blue,' said I, 'they are in with me, and we all go together.'\n",
      "\"Well, the matter ended by a second meeting, at which Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan, and Dost Akbar were all present.\n",
      "We talked the matter over again, and at last we came to an arrangement.\n",
      "We were to provide both the officers with charts of the part of the Agra fort and mark the place in the wall where the treasure was hid.\n",
      "Major Sholto was to go to India to test our story.\n",
      "If he found the box he was to leave it there, to send out a small yacht provisioned for a voyage, which was to lie off Rutland Island, and to which we were to make our way, and finally to return to his duties.\n",
      "Captain Morstan was then to apply for leave of absence, to meet us at Agra, and there we were to have a final division of the treasure, he taking the major's share as well as his own.\n",
      "All this we sealed by the most solemn oaths that the mind could think or the lips utter.\n",
      "I sat up all night with paper and ink, and by the morning I had the two charts all ready, signed with the sign of four,--that is, of Abdullah, Akbar, Mahomet, and myself.\n",
      "\"Well, gentlemen, I weary you with my long story, and I know that my friend Mr. Jones is impatient to get me safely stowed in chokey.\n",
      "I'll make it as short as I can.\n",
      "The villain Sholto went off to India, but he never came back again.\n",
      "Captain Morstan showed me his name among a list of passengers in one of the mail-boats very shortly afterwards.\n",
      "His uncle had died, leaving him a fortune, and he had left the army, yet he could stoop to treat five men as he had treated us.\n",
      "Morstan went over to Agra shortly afterwards, and found, as we expected, that the treasure was indeed gone.\n",
      "The scoundrel had stolen it all, without carrying out one of the conditions on which we had sold him the secret.\n",
      "From that day I lived only for vengeance.\n",
      "I thought of it by day and I nursed it by night.\n",
      "It became an overpowering, absorbing passion with me. I cared nothing for the law,--nothing for the gallows. To escape, to track down Sholto, to have my hand upon his throat,--that was my one thought.\n",
      "Even the Agra treasure had come to be a smaller thing in my mind than the slaying of Sholto.\n",
      "\"Well, I have set my mind on many things in this life, and never one which I did not carry out.\n",
      "But it was weary years before my time came.\n",
      "I have told you that I had picked up something of medicine.\n",
      "One day when Dr. Somerton was down with a fever a little Andaman Islander was picked up by a convict-gang in the woods.\n",
      "He was sick to death, and had gone to a lonely place to die.\n",
      "I took him in hand, though he was as venomous as a young snake, and after a couple of months I got him all right and able to walk.\n",
      "He took a kind of fancy to me then, and would hardly go back to his woods, but was always hanging about my hut.\n",
      "I learned a little of his lingo from him, and this made him all the fonder of me.\n",
      "\"Tonga--for that was his name--was a fine boatman, and owned a big, roomy canoe of his own.\n",
      "When I found that he was devoted to me and would do anything to serve me, I saw my chance of escape.\n",
      "I talked it over with him.\n",
      "He was to bring his boat round on a certain night to an old wharf which was never guarded, and there he was to pick me up.\n",
      "I gave him directions to have several gourds of water and a lot of yams, cocoa-nuts, and sweet potatoes.\n",
      "\"He was stanch and true, was little Tonga.\n",
      "No man ever had a more faithful mate.\n",
      "At the night named he had his boat at the wharf.\n",
      "As it chanced, however, there was one of the convict-guard down there,--a vile Pathan who had never missed a chance of insulting and injuring me. I had always vowed vengeance, and now I had my chance.\n",
      "It was as if fate had placed him in my way that I might pay my debt before I left the island.\n",
      "He stood on the bank with his back to me, and his carbine on his shoulder.\n",
      "I looked about for a stone to beat out his brains with, but none could I see.\n",
      "\"Then a queer thought came into my head and showed me where I could lay my hand on a weapon.\n",
      "I sat down in the darkness and unstrapped my wooden leg.\n",
      "With three long hops I was on him.\n",
      "He put his carbine to his shoulder, but I struck him full, and knocked the whole front of his skull in.\n",
      "You can see the split in the wood now where I hit him.\n",
      "We both went down together, for I could not keep my balance, but when I got up I found him still lying quiet enough.\n",
      "I made for the boat, and in an hour we were well out at sea.\n",
      "Tonga had brought all his earthly possessions with him, his arms and his gods.\n",
      "Among other things, he had a long bamboo spear, and some Andaman cocoa-nut matting, with which I made a sort of sail.\n",
      "For ten days we were beating about, trusting to luck, and on the eleventh we were picked up by a trader which was going from Singapore to Jiddah with a cargo of Malay pilgrims.\n",
      "They were a rum crowd, and Tonga and I soon managed to settle down among them.\n",
      "They had one very good quality: they let you alone and asked no questions.\n",
      "\"Well, if I were to tell you all the adventures that my little chum and I went through, you would not thank me, for I would have you here until the sun was shining.\n",
      "Here and there we drifted about the world, something always turning up to keep us from London.\n",
      "All the time, however, I never lost sight of my purpose.\n",
      "I would dream of Sholto at night.\n",
      "A hundred times I have killed him in my sleep.\n",
      "At last, however, some three or four years ago, we found ourselves in England.\n",
      "I had no great difficulty in finding where Sholto lived, and I set to work to discover whether he had realized the treasure, or if he still had it.\n",
      "I made friends with someone who could help me,--I name no names, for I don't want to get any one else in a hole,--and I soon found that he still had the jewels.\n",
      "Then I tried to get at him in many ways; but he was pretty sly, and had always two prize-fighters, besides his sons and his khitmutgar, on guard over him.\n",
      "\"One day, however, I got word that he was dying.\n",
      "I hurried at once to the garden, mad that he should slip out of my clutches like that, and, looking through the window, I saw him lying in his bed, with his sons on each side of him.\n",
      "I'd have come through and taken my chance with the three of them, only even as I looked at him his jaw dropped, and I knew that he was gone.\n",
      "I got into his room that same night, though, and I searched his papers to see if there was any record of where he had hidden our jewels.\n",
      "There was not a line, however: so I came away, bitter and savage as a man could be.\n",
      "Before I left I bethought me that if I ever met my Sikh friends again it would be a satisfaction to know that I had left some mark of our hatred: so I scrawled down the sign of the four of us, as it had been on the chart, and I pinned it on his bosom.\n",
      "It was too much that he should be taken to the grave without some token from the men whom he had robbed and befooled.\n",
      "\"We earned a living at this time by my exhibiting poor Tonga at fairs and other such places as the black cannibal.\n",
      "He would eat raw meat and dance his war-dance: so we always had a hatful of pennies after a day's work.\n",
      "I still heard all the news from Pondicherry Lodge, and for some years there was no news to hear, except that they were hunting for the treasure.\n",
      "At last, however, came what we had waited for so long.\n",
      "The treasure had been found.\n",
      "It was up at the top of the house, in Mr. Bartholomew Sholto's chemical laboratory.\n",
      "I came at once and had a look at the place, but I could not see how with my wooden leg I was to make my way up to it.\n",
      "I learned, however, about a trap-door in the roof, and also about Mr. Sholto's supper-hour.\n",
      "It seemed to me that I could manage the thing easily through Tonga.\n",
      "I brought him out with me with a long rope wound round his waist.\n",
      "He could climb like a cat, and he soon made his way through the roof, but, as ill luck would have it, Bartholomew Sholto was still in the room, to his cost.\n",
      "Tonga thought he had done something very clever in killing him, for when I came up by the rope I found him strutting about as proud as a peacock.\n",
      "Very much surprised was he when I made at him with the rope's end and cursed him for a little blood-thirsty imp.\n",
      "I took the treasure-box and let it down, and then slid down myself, having first left the sign of the four upon the table, to show that the jewels had come back at last to those who had most right to them.\n",
      "Tonga then pulled up the rope, closed the window, and made off the way that he had come.\n",
      "\"I don't know that I have anything else to tell you. I had heard a waterman speak of the speed of Smith's launch, the Aurora, so I thought she would be a handy craft for our escape. I engaged with old Smith, and was to give him a big sum if he got us safe to our ship. He knew, no doubt, that there was some screw loose, but he was not in our secrets. All this is the truth, and if I tell it to you, gentlemen, it is not to amuse you,--for you have not done me a very good turn,--but it is because I believe the best defence I can make is just to hold back nothing, but let all the world know how badly I have myself been served by Major Sholto, and how innocent I am of the death of his son.\"\n",
      "\"A very remarkable account,\" said Sherlock Holmes.\n",
      "\"A fitting wind-up to an extremely interesting case. There is nothing at all new to me in the latter part of your narrative, except that you brought your own rope. That I did not know. By the way, I had hoped that Tonga had lost all his darts; yet he managed to shoot one at us in the boat.\"\n",
      "\"He had lost them all, sir, except the one which was in his blow-pipe at the time.\"\n",
      "\"Ah, of course,\" said Holmes.\n",
      "\"I had not thought of that.\"\n",
      "\"Is there any other point which you would like to ask about?\" asked the convict, affably.\n",
      "\"I think not, thank you,\" my companion answered.\n",
      "\"Well, Holmes,\" said Athelney Jones, \"You are a man to be humored, and we all know that you are a connoisseur of crime, but duty is duty, and I have gone rather far in doing what you and your friend asked me. I shall feel more at ease when we have our story-teller here safe under lock and key. The cab still waits, and there are two inspectors down-stairs. I am much obliged to you both for your assistance. Of course you will be wanted at the trial. Good-night to you.\"\n",
      "\"Good-night, gentlemen both,\" said Jonathan Small.\n",
      "\"You first, Small,\" remarked the wary Jones as they left the room.\n",
      "\"I'll take particular care that you don't club me with your wooden leg, whatever you may have done to the gentleman at the Andaman Isles.\"\n",
      "\"Well, and there is the end of our little drama,\" I remarked, after we had set some time smoking in silence.\n",
      "\"I fear that it may be the last investigation in which I shall have the chance of studying your methods. Miss Morstan has done me the honor to accept me as a husband in prospective.\"\n",
      "He gave a most dismal groan.\n",
      "\"I feared as much,\" said he.\n",
      "\"I really cannot congratulate you.\"\n",
      "I was a little hurt.\n",
      "\"Have you any reason to be dissatisfied with my choice?\"\n",
      "I asked.\n",
      "\"Not at all. I think she is one of the most charming young ladies I ever met, and might have been most useful in such work as we have been doing. She had a decided genius that way: witness the way in which she preserved that Agra plan from all the other papers of her father. But love is an emotional thing, and whatever is emotional is opposed to that true cold reason which I place above all things. I should never marry myself, lest I bias my judgment.\"\n",
      "\"I trust,\" said I, laughing, \"that my judgment may survive the ordeal. But you look weary.\"\n",
      "\"Yes, the reaction is already upon me. I shall be as limp as a rag for a week.\"\n",
      "\"Strange,\" said I, \"how terms of what in another man I should call laziness alternate with your fits of splendid energy and vigor.\"\n",
      "\"Yes,\" he answered, \"there are in me the makings of a very fine loafer and also of a pretty spry sort of fellow.\n",
      "I often think of those lines of old Goethe,--\n",
      "Schade, daß die Natur nur einen Mensch aus Dir schuf, Denn zum würdigen Mann war und zum Schelmen der Stoff.\n",
      "\"By the way, a propos of this Norwood business, you see that they had, as I surmised, a confederate in the house, who could be none other than Lal Rao, the butler: so Jones actually has the undivided honor of having caught one fish in his great haul.\"\n",
      "\"The division seems rather unfair,\" I remarked.\n",
      "\"You have done all the work in this business. I get a wife out of it, Jones gets the credit, pray what remains for you?\"\n",
      "\"For me,\" said Sherlock Holmes, \"there still remains the cocaine-bottle.\"\n",
      "And he stretched his long white hand up for it.\n"

      "Die Wissenschaft der Deduktion\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes nahm seine Flasche von der Ecke des Kaminsimses und eine Spritze aus seinem geschmackvollen marokkanischen Etui.\n",
      "Mit seinen langen, weißen, nervösen Fingern befestigte er die dünne Nadel, und rollte seinen linken Hemdärmel hoch.\n",
      "Für kurze Zeit ruhten seine Augen nachdenklich auf dem sehnigen Unterarm und dem Handgelenk mit all den sichtbaren und vernarbten Einstichpunkten.\n",
      "Schließlich stieß er die Nadelspitze ein, drückte den winzigen Kolben und sank mit einem langen, zufriedenen Seufzer in den samtgefütterten Lehnstuhl zurück.\n",
      "Dreimal täglich und über viele Monate hatte ich diesem Vorgang zugesehen, aber ich hatte mich nie daran gewöhnt.\n",
      "Im Gegenteil, von Tag zu Tag war ich beim Anblick dieser Prozedur reizbarer geworden, und mein Gewissen bedrückte mich jede Nacht schwerer, obgleich mir der Mut zum Protestieren fehlte.\n",
      "Wieder und wieder hatte ich mir vorgenommen, daß ich dieses Thema ansprechen sollte, aber die kühle, nonchalante Art meines Freundes machten ihn nicht zu jemandem, dem gegenüber man sich solche Freiheiten erlauben würde.\n",
      "Seine großen Fähigkeiten, seine meisterhafte Art, und mein Wissen über seine vielen außerordentlichen Qualitäten – all dies ließ mich davor zurückschrecken, ihn zu verärgern.\n",
      "Aber an diesem Nachmittag, ob es nun der Bordeaux war, den ich zum Mittagessen getrunken hatte, oder meine besondere Verärgerung über seine vorsätzliche Handlungsweise; ich fühlte plötzlich, daß ich nicht länger schweigen konnte.\n",
      "»Was ist es heute?« fragte ich. »Morphium oder Kokain?«\n",
      "Er hob seine Augen träge von dem alten, bibliophilen Band, den er aufgeschlagen hatte.\n",
      "»Es ist Kokain,« sagte er, »eine siebenprozentige Lösung.\n",
      "Möchten Sie es probieren?«\n",
      "»Nein, danke«, antwortete ich brüsk. »Ich habe mich noch nicht von der afghanischen Kampagne erholt.\n",
      "Ich kann mir keine zusätzliche Belastung leisten.«\n",
      "Er lächelte über meine Vehemenz.\n",
      "»Vielleicht haben Sie recht, Watson,« sagte er. »Ich nehme an, es hat körperlich einen schlechten Einfluß.\n",
      "Ich finde es aber so stimulierend und die Klarheit des Verstandes fördernd, daß seine sekundären Auswirkungen zweitrangig sind«.\n",
      "»Aber sehen Sie!« sagte ich ernsthaft. »Bedenken Sie den Preis!\n",
      "Ihr Gehirn mag, wie Sie sagen, angeregt und stimuliert werden, aber durch einen pathologischen und krankhaften Prozeß, der mögliche Gewebeveränderung mit sich bringt und vielleicht auch eine andauernde Schwäche.\n",
      "Sie wissen auch, welch dunkle Reaktion Sie manchmal überkommt.\n",
      "Bestimmt ist das Spiel kaum den Einsatz wert.\n",
      "Warum sollten Sie für ein bloßes beiläufiges Vergnügen den Verlust jener großen Fähigkeiten riskieren, mit denen Sie ausgestattet worden sind?\n",
      "Denken Sie daran, daß ich nicht nur als ein Kamerad mit Ihnen spreche, sondern als Mediziner zu jemandem, für dessen Verfassung er in gewissem Maße verantwortlich ist.«\n",
      "Er schien nicht beleidigt.\n",
      "Im Gegenteil; er legte seinen Fingerspitzen zusammen und lehnte den Ellenbogen auf die Lehne seines Stuhles, ganz wie jemand, der Vergnügen an einer Unterhaltung hat.\n",
      "»Mein Verstand,« sagte er, »rebelliert gegen Stillstand.\n",
      "Geben Sie mir Probleme, geben Sie mir Arbeit, geben Sie mir das schwer verständlichste Kryptogramm oder die komplizierteste Analyse, und ich bin in der mir angemessenen Umgebung.\n",
      "Dann kann ich ohne künstliche Stimulantien auskommen.\n",
      "Aber ich verabscheue die Stumpfheit des täglichen Lebens.\n",
      "Ich hungere nach geistiger Aufregung.\n",
      "Das ist der Grund, warum ich diesen Beruf gewählt – oder geschaffen – habe denn ich bin der Einzige in der Welt«.\n",
      "»Der einzige inoffizielle Detektiv?« sagte ich und zog meine Augenbrauen hoch.\n",
      "»Der einzige inoffizielle beratende Detektiv,« antwortete er. »Ich bin die letzte und höchste Instanz bei der Aufklärung.\n",
      "Wenn Gregson oder Lestrade oder Athelney Jones unsicher sind – und das sind sie normalerweise – wird mir die Sache vorgelegt.\n",
      "Ich untersuche die Fakten als Experte und gebe die Meinung eines Spezialisten ab.\n",
      "In solchen Fällen erwarte ich keine Anerkennung.\n",
      "Mein Name steht in keiner Zeitung.\n",
      "Die Arbeit selbst, das Vergnügen meine speziellen Fähigkeiten einsetzen zu können, ist meine höchste Belohnung.\n",
      "Im Jefferson Hope Fall haben Sie ja die Methoden meiner Arbeit kennengelernt.«\n",
      "»Ja, tatsächlich,« sagte ich freundlich, »nichts hat mich in meinem Leben so berührt.\n",
      "Ich habe es sogar in einer kleinen Broschüre mit dem etwas phantastischen Titel ›Eine scharlachrote Studie‹ beschrieben.«\n",
      "Betrübt schüttelte er den Kopf.\n",
      "»Ich habe es überflogen,« sagte er. »Ehrlich gesagt, kann ich Ihnen dazu nicht gratulieren.\n",
      "Detektivarbeit ist – oder sollte es zumindest sein – eine genaue Wissenschaft, und sie sollte genauso kalt und sachlich behandelt werden.\n",
      "Sie haben versucht, Romantik hineinzubringen.\n",
      "Das hat die gleiche Wirkung, als wenn Sie eine Liebesgeschichte oder eine Trennungsgeschichte in den fünften Lehrsatz von Euklid einbauen würden.«\n",
      "»Aber die Romanze war vorhanden,« protestierte ich. »Ich konnte die Tatsachen ja nicht verändern.«\n",
      "»Einige Tatsachen sollten ausgelassen werden, oder wenigstens ein gesundes Maß an Verhältnismäßigkeit bei ihrer Erwähnung beachtet werden.\n",
      "Der einzige Punkt im diesem Fall, der Erwähnung verdiente, war das neugierige, analytische und logische Ergründen von Ursachen und Wirkungen, durch das ich den Fall erfolgreich enträtseln konnte.«\n",
      "Diese Kritik an meiner Arbeit ärgerte mich, da ich sie insbesondere geschrieben hatte, um ihm zu gefallen.\n",
      "Ich gestehe auch, daß ich mich über seine Selbstgefälligkeit ärgerte, die zu fordern schien, daß jede Zeile meines Pamphletes sich seinem speziellen Handeln widmete.\n",
      "Mehr als einmal hatte ich während all der Jahre, die ich mit ihm in der Baker Street lebte beobachtet, daß eine kleine Eitelkeit der stillen und belehrenden Art meines Begleiters zugrunde lag.\n",
      "Ich erwiderte jedoch nichts, sondern pflegte mein verwundetes Bein.\n",
      "Ich war vor einiger Zeit von einer Kugel getroffen worden und obwohl sie mich nicht am Gehen hinderte, schmerzte die Wunde bei jeder Wetteränderung.\n",
      "»Meine Geschäfte haben sich vor kurzem bis auf das Festland ausgeweitet,« sagte Holmes während er seine Bruyère-Pfeife nachstopfte. »Ich wurde letzte Woche von Francois Le Villard konsultiert, der, wie Sie wahrscheinlich wissen, kürzlich zum Einsatz im französischen Detektivdienst gekommen ist.\n",
      "Er hat all die keltische Macht schneller Intuition, aber es fehlt ihm die Bandbreite exakten Wissens, die zu der höheren Entwicklung seiner Kunst wesentlich ist.\n",
      "Bei dem Fall ging es um ein Testament und es gab einige interessante Aspekte.\n",
      "Ich konnte ihn auf zwei ähnliche Fälle hinweisen, der eine trug sich in Riga im Jahr 1857 zu, und der andere in St. Louis im Jahr 1871; beide habe ich ihm zur Lösung vorgeschlagen.\n",
      "Hier ist der Brief, den ich heute morgen erhielt und in dem er mir für meine Hilfe dankt.« Während er sprach, warf er ein zerdrücktes Blatt ausländischen Briefpapieres hinüber . Ich überflog es und bemerkte eine Fülle bewundernder Anmerkungen, in denen die Worte »magnifiques«, »Coup-de-maîtres«, und »Tour-de-force« eingestreut waren, alle ein Zeichen der leidenschaftlichen Bewunderung des Franzosen.\n",
      "»Er spricht wie ein Schüler zu seinem Meister,« sagte ich.\n",
      "»Ach, er überschätzt meine Hilfe,« sagte Sherlock Holmes leichthin. »Er hat selbst beträchtliches Talent.\n",
      "Er besitzt zwei der drei notwendigen Qualitäten für den idealen Detektiv.\n",
      "Er hat die Fähigkeit der Beobachtung und der Deduktion.\n",
      "Ihm fehlt nur das Wissen; und das kommt vielleicht noch.\n",
      "Er übersetzt jetzt meine kleineren Arbeiten ins Französische«.\n",
      "»Ihre Arbeiten?«\n",
      "»Ach, wußten Sie das nicht?« rief er und lachte. »Ja, ich bin für mehrere Monographien verantwortlich.\n",
      "Sie beruhen alle auf technischen Themen.\n",
      "Hier ist zum Beispiel mein Werk ›Über den Unterschied zwischen den Aschen verschiedener Tabake‹.\n",
      "In ihm zähle ich einhundertundvierzig Formen von Zigarren-, Zigaretten- und Pfeifentabaken auf, mit farbigen Abbildungen, die den Unterschied in der Asche illustrieren.\n",
      "Es ist ein Punkt, der ständig in kriminellen Versuchen auftaucht, und welcher manchmal von größter Wichtigkeit als Anhaltspunkt ist.\n",
      "Wenn Sie definitiv sagen können, zum Beispiel, daß irgendein Mord von einem Mann gemacht worden ist, der einen indischen lunkah rauchte, grenzt es Ihre Suche offensichtlich ein.\n",
      "Für ein trainiertes Auge gibt es daher mehr Unterschiede zwischen der schwarzen Asche von einer Trichinopoly und der weißen Fussel von Bird's Eye als zwischen einem Kohlkopf und einer Kartoffel.«\n",
      "»Sie haben eine außerordentliche Begabung für Details,« bemerkte ich.\n",
      "»Ich schätze ihre Wichtigkeit.\n",
      "Hier ist meine Monographie über die Aufzeichnung von Fußabdrücken, mit einigen Bemerkungen über die Verwendung von Gips zur Aufbewahrung von Abdrücken.\n",
      "Hier ist auch eine witzige kleine Arbeit über den Einfluß eines Berufes auf die Form der Hand, mit Lithographien der Hände von Dachdeckern, Seeleuten, Korkenschnitzern, Schriftsetzern, Webern, und Diamantschleifern.\n",
      "Das ist eine Sache großen praktischen Interesses für den wissenschaftlichen Detektiv – besonders in Fällen nicht identifizierter Leichen oder im Entdecken des Vorfahren von Verbrechern.\n",
      "Aber ich ermüde Sie mit meinem Hobby.«\n",
      "»Nicht im geringsten,« antwortete ich ernsthaft. »Es ist vom größten Interesse für mich, besonders, weil ich beobachten konnte, wie Sie daraus Nutzen ziehen konnten.\n",
      "Aber Sie sprachen eben von Beobachtung und Deduktion.\n",
      "Bestimmt bedingt das Eine in gewissem Maße das Andere.«\n",
      "»Nein, kaum,« antwortete er und lehnte sich in seinem luxuriösen Lehnstuhl zurück, wobei er dicke blaue Rauchschwaden aus seiner Pfeife abgab. »Zum Beispiel zeigt mir die Beobachtung, daß Sie heute morgen im Wigmore Street Postamt gewesen sind, und die Deduktion sagt mir, daß Sie dort ein Telegramm abgesandt haben.«\n",
      "»Richtig!« sagte ich. »Sie haben in beiden Recht!\n",
      "Aber ich gestehe, daß ich nicht sehe, wie Sie zu diesem Schluß gekommen sind.\n",
      "Es war ein spontaner Einfall meinerseits und ich habe es niemandem erzählt.«\n",
      "»Es ist ganz einfach,« bemerkte er und lachte über meine Überraschung, »so absurd einfach, daß eine Erklärung überflüssig ist; und doch hilft es vielleicht, die Grenzen zwischen Beobachtung und Deduktion zu definieren.\n",
      "Die Beobachtung sagt mir, daß Sie ein wenig rötliche Erde an Ihrem Schuh haben.\n",
      "Genau gegenüber von Wigmore Street hat man den Bürgersteig aufgerissen und die Erde angehäuft.\n",
      "Sie liegt derart, daß es schwierig zu vermeiden ist, in sie zu treten.\n",
      "Die Erde ist von diesem eigenen rötlichen Farbton, der nirgendwo sonst in der Nachbarschaft gefunden wird.\n",
      "Dies ist die Beobachtung.\n",
      "Der Rest ist Deduktion.«\n",
      "»Wie folgerten Sie das Telegramm daraus?«\n",
      "»Natürlich wußte ich, daß Sie keinen Brief geschrieben hatten, weil ich Ihnen den ganzen Morgen gegenüber saß.\n",
      "Ich sehe auch dort in Ihrem offenen Schreibtisch, daß Sie ein Heftchen von Briefmarken und ein dickes Päckchen Postkarten haben.\n",
      "Weshalb sollten Sie sonst zur Post gehen, wenn Sie nicht ein Telegramm aufgeben wollten?\n",
      "Wenn man alle anderen Faktoren ausschließt, muß was übrig bleibt die Wahrheit sein.«\n",
      "»In diesem Fall ist das richtig,« erwiderte ich nach kurzer Überlegung. »Wie Sie aber sagen, ist dies ein einfacher Fall.\n",
      "Würden Sie mich für unverschämt halten, wenn ich Ihre Theorien einer strengeren Prüfung unterziehe?«\n",
      "»Im Gegenteil,« antwortete er, »es würde mich hindern, eine zweite Dosis Kokain zu nehmen.\n",
      "Ich würde gerne jedes Problem untersuchen, das Sie mir nennen können.«\n",
      "»Ich habe Sie sagen gehört, daß es für einen Mann schwierig ist, einen Gegenstand täglich zu verwenden, ohne einen Abdruck seiner Persönlichkeit auf ihm zu belassen, den ein trainierter Beobachter nicht erkennen könnte.\n",
      "Ich habe hier eine Armbanduhr, die vor kurzem in meinen Besitz gekommen ist.\n",
      "Könnten Sie mir freundlicherweise eine Beschreibung über den Charakter oder die Gewohnheiten des letzten Besitzers geben?«\n",
      "Ich übergab ihm die Armbanduhr mit einem gewissen Gefühl der Belustigung, denn die Prüfung war wie ich dachte unmöglich, und ich beabsichtigte sie als eine Lehre gegen den etwas dogmatischen Ton, den er gelegentlich annahm.\n",
      "Er balancierte die Armbanduhr in seiner Hand, starrte das Zifferblatt an, öffnete den Rücken und untersuchte die Arbeit, zuerst mit bloßem Auge und dann mit einer mächtigen konvexen Linse.\n",
      "Ich konnte kaum das Lächeln über sein geknicktes Gesicht unterdrücken, als er den Deckel schließlich zuschnappen ließ und die Uhr zurückgab.\n",
      "»Es gibt kaum irgendwelche Daten,« bemerkte er. »Die Armbanduhr ist vor kurzem gereinigt worden, was mir die aufschlußreichsten Fakten nimmt.«\n",
      "»Sie haben recht,« antwortete ich. »Sie wurde gereinigt, bevor sie zu mir geschickt wurde.« Tief im Innern beschuldigte ich meinen Gefährten, mir eine lahme und leere Entschuldigung anzubieten, nur um seinen Mißerfolg zu verschleiern.\n",
      "Welche Fakten könnte er von einer ungereinigten Armbanduhr erwarten?\n",
      "»Obwohl unbefriedigend, ist meine Forschung nicht völlig unfruchtbar gewesen,« bemerkte er und starrte mit verträumten Augen an die Decke. »Korrigieren Sie mich, wenn ich falsch liege, aber ich nehme an, daß die Armbanduhr Ihrem älteren Bruder gehörte, der sie von Ihrem Vater erbte.«\n",
      "»Was Sie ohne Zweifel dem H. W. auf der Rückseite entnehmen«?\n",
      "»So ist es.\n",
      "Das W. deutet auf Ihren eigenen Namen hin.\n",
      "Das Datum auf der Armbanduhr ist beinahe fünfzig Jahre her, und die Initialen sind so alt wie die Armbanduhr: deshalb wurde es für die vorige Generation gemacht.\n",
      "Schmuck fällt normalerweise dem ältesten Sohn zu, und es ist sehr wahrscheinlich, daß er den gleichen Namen wie der Vater hat.\n",
      "Ihr Vater ist seit vielen Jahren tot, wenn ich mich recht erinnere.\n",
      "Die Uhr ist deshalb in den Händen Ihres ältesten Bruders gewesen.«\n",
      "»So weit, so gut,« sagte ich. »Sonst noch etwas?«\n",
      "»Er war ein Mann von unordentlichen Angewohnheiten – sehr unordentlich und nachlässig.\n",
      "Er wurde mit guten Aussichten von der Familie ausgestattet, aber er warf seine Chancen weg.\n",
      "Er lebte einige Zeit in Armut, unterbrochen von kurzen Intervallen von Reichtum.\n",
      "Schließlich starb er an seiner Trunksucht.\n",
      "Das ist alles, was ich zusammenbekommen kann.«\n",
      "Ich sprang von meinem Stuhl und humpelte ungeduldig im Zimmer umher und fühlte eine beträchtliche Bitterkeit im Herzen.\n",
      "»Dies ist Ihrer unwürdig, Holmes,« sagte ich. »Ich kann nicht glauben, daß Sie sich so tief sinken lassen.\n",
      "Sie haben sich nach der Geschichte meines unglücklichen Bruders erkundigt, und jetzt geben Sie vor, dieses Wissen auf irgendeine phantasiereiche Weise geschlußfolgert zu haben.\n",
      "Sie können nicht erwarten, daß ich glaube, daß Sie all dieses von seiner alten Armbanduhr abgelesen haben!\n",
      "Es ist unehrlich, und um es deutlich zu sagen, es hat einen Anflug von Scharlatanismus.«\n",
      "»Mein lieber Doktor,« sagte er freundlich, »bitte nehmen Sie meine Entschuldigung an.\n",
      "Die Sache als ein abstraktes Problem betrachtend, hatte ich vergessen, wie persönlich und schmerzhaft diese Sache für Sie sein könnte.\n",
      "Ich versichere Ihnen aber, daß ich nicht wußte, daß Sie einen Bruder hatten, bis Sie mir die Armbanduhr gaben.«\n",
      "»Dann, wie um alle Welt, bekamen Sie diese Tatsachen?\n",
      "Sie sind in jeder Beziehung richtig.«\n",
      "»Ah, das war Glück.\n",
      "Ich kann nur sagen, es war das Gleichgewicht der Wahrscheinlichkeit.\n",
      "Ich hatte nicht erwartet, so genau zu sein.«\n",
      "»Aber war es nicht ein bloßes Raten?«\n",
      "»Nein, nein: Ich rate nie.\n",
      "Es ist eine schockierende Angewohnheit – zerstörerisch für die logischen Fähigkeiten.\n",
      "Es erscheint Ihnen nur seltsam, weil Sie meinem Gedankengang nicht folgen oder die kleinen Tatsachen beobachten können, von denen große Schlußfolgerungen vielleicht abhängen.\n",
      "Zum Beispiel fing ich an, indem ich angab, daß Ihr Bruder nachlässig war.\n",
      "Wenn Sie den einfachen Teil dieses Uhrgehäuses beobachten, merken Sie, daß er nicht nur an zwei Stellen eingebeult ist.\n",
      "Das Gehäuse ist völlig von der Gewohnheit gezeichnet, zusammen mit anderen harte Gegenständen aufbewahrt zu werden, wie Münzen oder Schlüsseln, die in die gleiche Tasche wandern.\n",
      "Bestimmt ist es keine große Leistung anzunehmen, daß ein Mann ein nachlässiger Mann sein muß, der eine fünfzig-Guinee-Armbanduhr so sorglos behandelt.\n",
      "Auch ist es keine sehr weit hergeholte Schlußfolgerung, daß ein Mann, der einen Artikel solchen Wertes erbt, auch sonst gut ausgestattet ist.\n",
      "Ich nickte um zu zeigen, daß ich seinem logische Denken folgte.\n",
      "»Es ist für Pfandleiher in England sehr üblich, die Nummer des Pfandscheins mit einer Nadel in das Gehäuse einzuritzen, wenn sie eine Armbanduhr annehmen.\n",
      "Es ist geschickter als eine Aufschrift, denn so besteht kein Risiko, die Nummer zu verlieren.\n",
      "Es gibt nicht weniger als vier solcher Zahlen unter meiner Lupe im Inneren dieses Uhrgehäuses.\n",
      "Ein Indiz, daß Ihr Bruder oft in Geldschwierigkeiten steckte.\n",
      "Sekundäres Indiz – daß er gelegentliche Anfälle von Wohlstand hatte, oder er könnte den Pfand nicht eingelöst haben.\n",
      "Schließlich bitte ich Sie, den inneren Teil anzuschauen, der das Schlüsselloch enthält.\n",
      "Schauen Sie die vielen Kratzer um das Schlüsselloch herum an, wo der Schlüssel abgerutscht ist.\n",
      "Könnte der Schlüssel eines nüchternen Mannes jene Furchen erzeugt haben?\n",
      "Aber die Armbanduhr eines Trinkers werden Sie nie ohne sie sehen.\n",
      "Er dreht das Uhrwerk bei Nacht auf, und er hinterläßt diese Spuren seiner unsicheren Hand.\n",
      "Wo ist das Rätsel in all diesem?«\n",
      "»Es ist sonnenklar,« antwortete ich. »Ich bedaure die Ungerechtigkeit, mit der ich Sie behandelt habe.\n",
      "Ich sollte mehr Glauben in Ihre fantastische Wissenschaft haben.\n",
      "Darf ich fragen, ob Sie momentan eine geschäftliche Anfrage haben?«\n",
      "»Keine.\n",
      "Daher das Kokain.\n",
      "Ich kann nicht ohne Kopfarbeit leben.\n",
      "Wofür sonst sollte man leben?\n",
      "Stellen Sie sich hier ans Fenster.\n",
      "Gab es je eine so düstere, triste, unrentable Welt?\n",
      "Sehen Sie, wie der gelbe Nebel die Straße und die graubraunen Häuser entlang wirbelt?\n",
      "Was könnte hoffnungsloser prosaisch und gegenständlich sein?\n",
      "Warum hat man Fähigkeiten, Doktor, wenn man keine Möglichkeit hat, sie einzusetzen?\n",
      "Verbrechen ist alltäglich, Existenz ist alltäglich, und Qualitäten, die nicht alltäglich sind, haben keine Funktion in der Welt«.\n",
      "Ich hatte meinen Mund geöffnet, um dieser Tirade zu entgegnen, als unsere Wirtin mit einem herzhaften Klopfen an die Tür eintrat und eine Karte auf dem Messing-Tablett präsentierte.\n",
      "»Eine junge Dame für Sie, Herr,« sagte sie an meinen Gefährten gewandt.\n",
      "»Fräulein Mary Morstan,« las er. »Hmm!« Ich erinnere mich nicht an den Namen.\n",
      "Bitten Sie die junge Dame hereinzukommen, Frau Hudson.\n",
      "Gehen Sie nicht, Doktor.\n",
      "Ich wünsche, daß Sie bleiben.«\n",
      "Die Beschreibung des Falles\n",
      "Mit festem Schritt und äußerst gefaßt betrat Fräulein Morstan das Zimmer.\n",
      "Sie war eine blonde junge Dame, klein, zierlich, und geschmackvoll gekleidet.\n",
      "Die Einfachheit ihres Kostüms zeigte aber auch ihre begrenzten Mittel, die sie für Bekleidung ausgeben konnte.\n",
      "Das Kleid war in düsterem gräulichem Beige, ohne Besatz und ohne Bordüren, und sie trug einen kleinen Turban der gleichen stumpfen Farbe, der nur von einer weißer Feder an der Seite aufgelockert wurde.\n",
      "Ihr Gesicht hatte weder besondere Merkmale noch sonstige Charakteristika, aber ihr Eindruck war nett und liebenswürdig, und die großen blauen Augen waren außerordentlich sinnlich und teilnahmsvoll.\n",
      "In meiner Erfahrung mit Frauen, die sich über viele Nationen und drei getrennten Kontinente erstreckt, habe ich kein Gesicht mit einer klareren Verheißung einer so feinen und empfindsamen Natur gesehen.\n",
      "Ich konnte nichts anderes tun als zu beobachten, wie ihre Lippen und ihre Hand zitterten, als sie den Platz nahm, den Sherlock Holmes ihr anbot.\n",
      "Sie zeigte deutliche Anzeichen intensiver innerer Erregung.\n",
      "»Ich bin zu Ihnen, Herr Holmes, gekommen,« sagte sie, »weil Sie meinem Arbeitgeber – Frau Cecil Forrester – halfen, einige häusliche Komplikationen zu entwirren.\n",
      "Sie war von Ihrer Freundlichkeit und Ihren Fähigkeiten sehr beeindruckt.«\n",
      "»Frau Cecil Forrester,« wiederholte er gedankenvoll. »Ich glaube, daß ich ihr einen kleinen Gefallen tat.\n",
      "Aber es war ein sehr einfacher Fall, wenn ich mich recht erinnere«.\n",
      "»Sie denkt anders darüber.\n",
      "Aber wenigstens können Sie von mir nicht das Gleiche sagen.\n",
      "Ich kann mir kaum etwas Seltsameres, etwas gänzlich Unerklärbareres vorstellen, als die Situation, in der ich mich befinde.«\n",
      "Holmes rieb seine Hände und seine Augen funkelten.\n",
      "Er lehnte sich mit einem Ausdruck außerordentlicher Konzentration auf seinen klaren, falkenähnlichen Zügen in seinem Stuhl vor.\n",
      "»Beschreiben Sie Ihren Fall,« sagte er in lebhaftem Geschäftston.\n",
      "Ich empfand mich in einer peinlichen Lage.\n",
      "»Sie werden mich sicherlich entschuldigen,« sagte ich und erhob mich von meinem Stuhl.\n",
      "Zu meiner Überraschung hob die junge Dame ihre behandschuhte Hand, um mich aufzuhalten.\n",
      "»Wenn Ihr Freund hierbleiben würde,« sagte sie, »könnte er von unschätzbarem Dienst für mich sein.«\n",
      "Ich fiel in meinen Stuhl zurück.\n",
      "»Kurz gesagt,« setzte sie fort, »die Tatsachen sind diese.\n",
      "Mein Vater, der mich nach Hause schickte, als ich noch ein Kind war, war Offizier in einem indischen Regiment.\n",
      "Meine Mutter war tot, und ich hatte keine Verwandten in England.\n",
      "Ich wurde in einer komfortablen Pension bei Edinburgh untergebracht, und dort blieb ich, bis ich siebzehn Jahre alt war.\n",
      "Im Jahr 1878 erhielt mein Vater, der der ranghöchste Kapitän seines Regimentes war, zwölf Monate Urlaub und kam nach Hause.\n",
      "Er telegrafierte mir von London aus, daß er sicher angekommen war, und bat mich nach London zu kommen.\n",
      "Er gab das Langham Hotel als seine Adresse an.\n",
      "Seine Mitteilung war, wie ich mich erinnere, freundlich und liebvoll.\n",
      "In London angekommen, fuhr ich zum Langham Hotel und wurde dort informiert, daß Kapitän Morstan dort wohne, aber daß er in der vorigen Nacht das Hotel verlassen hatte und noch nicht zurückgekommen sei.\n",
      "Ich wartete mehrere Tage ohne Nachricht von ihm.\n",
      "Eines abends, auf Rat des Hotelmanagers, sprach ich mit der Polizei, und am nächsten Morgen inserierten wir in allen Zeitungen.\n",
      "Unsere Nachforschungen waren ohne Ergebnis; und seit jenen Tagen ist kein Wort mehr von meinem unglücklichen Vater gehört worden.\n",
      "Er kam nach Hause mit dem Herzen voller Hoffnung, Frieden zu finden, und stattdessen –« Sie führte die Hand zu ihrer Kehle, und ein würgender Schluchzer beendete den Satz.\n",
      "»Das Datum?« fragte Holmes und öffnete sein Notizbuch.\n",
      "»Er verschwand am 3. Dezember 1878, vor beinahe zehn Jahren.«\n",
      "»Sein Gepäck?«\n",
      "»Blieb im Hotel.\n",
      "Es enthielt nichts, was einen Hinweis geben könnte – einige Kleider, einige Bücher, und eine beträchtliche Anzahl von Kuriositäten von den Andaman Inseln.\n",
      "Er war dort einer der diensthabenden Offiziere der Strafkolonie.\n",
      "»Hatte er irgendwelche Freunde in der Stadt?«\n",
      "»Wir kennen nur einen – Major Sholto.\n",
      "Er ist aus seinem eigenen Regiment, der 34. Bombay Infanterie.\n",
      "Der Major war kurze Zeit vorher in Pension gegangen, und lebte in Upper Norwood.\n",
      "Wir korrespondierten natürlich mit ihm, aber er wußte nicht einmal, daß sein Offiziersfreund in England war.«\n",
      "»Ein eigenartiger Fall,« bemerkte Holmes.\n",
      "»Ich habe Ihnen noch nicht den eigenartigsten Teil beschrieben.\n",
      "Vor ungefähr sechs Jahren – um genau zu sein, am 4. Mai, 1882 – erschien eine Anzeige in der Times, in der nach der Adresse von Fräulein Mary Morstan gefragt wurde.\n",
      "Die Anzeige enthielt einen Hinweis, daß es zu ihrem Vorteil wäre.\n",
      "Es gab keinen Namen, keine Adresse war angegeben.\n",
      "Zu dieser Zeit hatte ich gerade meine Stelle als Gouvernante in der Familie von Frau Cecil Forrester angenommen.\n",
      "Auf ihren Rat hin veröffentlichte ich meine Adresse in den Anzeigenspalten.\n",
      "Am gleichen Tag kam eine kleine, an mich adressierte, Pappkiste mit der Post an, die eine sehr große und glänzende Perle enthielt.\n",
      "Es war kein Schreiben beigelegt.\n",
      "Seitdem ist dann jedes Jahr zum gleichen Zeitpunkt immer eine ähnliche Kiste angekommen und enthielt eine ähnliche Perle, ohne irgendeinen Anhaltspunkt über den Absender.\n",
      "Die Perlen sind von einem Experten geschätzt worden.\n",
      "Sie gehören zu einer seltenen Sorte und sind von beträchtlichem Wert.\n",
      "Sie können selbst sehen, daß sie sehr hübsch sind.« Sie öffnete eine flache Kiste, und zeigte mir sechs von den feinsten Perlen, die ich je gesehen hatte.\n",
      "»Ihre Behauptung ist höchst interessant,« sagte Sherlock Holmes. »Ist Ihnen sonst noch etwas besonderes passiert?«\n",
      "»Ja, und zwar heute.\n",
      "Darum bin ich zu Ihnen gekommen.\n",
      "Heute morgen bekam ich diesen Brief, wenn Sie ihn bitte lesen würden.«\n",
      "»Danke,« sagte Holmes. »Den Umschlag bitte auch.\n",
      "Abgestempelt in London, S.W., datiert den 7. Juli.\n",
      "Hmm!\n",
      "Ein Daumenabdruck an der Ecke – wahrscheinlich vom Briefträger.\n",
      "Papier der besten Qualität.\n",
      "Umschläge für Sixpence das Dutzend.\n",
      "Ein wählerischer Mann in seinen Schreibwaren.\n",
      "Keine Adresse.\n",
      "›Kommen Sie heute abend sieben Uhr zum dritten Pfeiler von links an der Außenmauer des Lyceum Theaters.\n",
      "Wenn Sie mißtrauisch sind, bringen Sie zwei Freunde mit.\n",
      "Sie sind ungerecht behandelt worden, und sollen Ihr Recht bekommen.\n",
      "Bringen Sie keine Polizei mit.\n",
      "Wenn Sie dies doch tun, wird alles vergeblich sein.\n",
      "Ihr unbekannter Freund.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "Tatsächlich, das ist ein hübsches kleines Rätsel.\n",
      "Was beabsichtigen Sie zu tun, Fräulein Morstan?«\n",
      "»Das ist genau das, was ich Sie fragen wollte.«\n",
      "»Dann sollten wir auf jeden Fall hingehen.\n",
      "Sie und ich und – ja, Dr. Watson ist der richtige Mann.\n",
      "Ihr Briefschreiber erwähnt zwei Freunde.\n",
      "Er und ich haben schon früher zusammengearbeitet.«\n",
      "»Aber käme er mit?« fragte sie mit einem bittenden Ton in ihrer Stimme und entsprechendem Gesichtsausdruck.\n",
      "»Ich bin stolz und froh,« sagte ich inbrünstig, »Ihnen zu Diensten sein zu können.«\n",
      "»Sie sind beide sehr freundlich,« antwortete sie. »Ich habe ein zurückgezogenes Leben geführt und habe keine Freunde, an die ich mich wenden könnte.\n",
      "Wenn ich hier um sechs eintreffe, wird es zeitig genug sein, nehme ich an?«\n",
      "»Sie sollten nicht später hier sein,« sagte Holmes. »Aber es gibt noch einen anderen Punkt.\n",
      "Ist diese Handschrift die gleiche wie die der Adressen auf den Perlenkästchen?«\n",
      "»Ich habe sie hier,« antwortete sie und zeigte ein halbes Dutzend Papierblätter.\n",
      "»Sie sind wirklich ein guter Klient.\n",
      "Sie haben die richtige Intuition.\n",
      "Lassen Sie uns sehen.« Er breitete die Dokumente auf dem Tisch aus, und warf flüchtige Blicke von einem Papier zum anderen. »Die Handschrift ist verstellt, aber nicht im Brief,« sagte er, »aber es kann keine Frage über die Autorschaft geben.\n",
      "Sehen Sie, wie der nicht unterdrückte griechische Buchstabe e ausbrechen will, und sehen Sie das Drehen des letzten s. Sie sind zweifellos von der gleichen Person geschrieben.\n",
      "Fräulein Morstan, ich möchte keine falschen Hoffnungen erwecken, aber gibt es irgendwelche Ähnlichkeit zwischen dieser Handschrift und der Ihres Vaters?«\n",
      "»Sie könnten nicht verschiedener sein.«\n",
      "»Ich habe erwartet, daß Sie das sagen.\n",
      "Wir werden dann um sechs nach Ihnen Ausschau halten.\n",
      "Bitte erlauben Sie mir, die Dokumente zu behalten.\n",
      "Ich schaue mir die Sache vielleicht vorher noch einmal an.\n",
      "Es ist jetzt erst halb vier.\n",
      "Au revoir dann.«\n",
      "»Au revoir,« sagte unsere Besucherin, und mit einem hellen, freundlichen Blick zu jedem von uns verbarg sie ihr Perlenkästchen in ihrem Busen und eilte fort.\n",
      "Am Fenster stehend beobachtete ich, wie sie lebhaft die Straße entlang ging, bis der graue Turban und die weiße Feder nur noch ein Fleck in der dunklen Menschenmenge waren.\n",
      "»Was für eine attraktive Frau!« rief ich aus und drehte mich zu meinem Begleiter.\n",
      "Er hatte seine Pfeife wieder angezündet und lehnte sich mit geschlossenen Augen zurück.\n",
      "»Ist sie das?« sagte er träge. »Ich habe es nicht bemerkt.«\n",
      "»Sie sind wirklich ein Automat, – eine Rechenmaschine!« rief ich aus. »Manchmal haben Sie etwas Unmenschliches an sich.«\n",
      "Er lächelte sachte.\n",
      "»Es ist von größter Wichtigkeit,« sagte er, »daß Ihr Urteil nicht von persönlichen Empfindungen vorbelastet ist.\n",
      "Ein Klient ist für mich nur eine Größe – ein Faktor in einem Problem.\n",
      "Die emotionalen Aspekte sind dem logischem Denken hinderlich.\n",
      "Ich versichere Ihnen, daß die hübscheste Frau, die ich je kannte, für das Vergiften von drei kleinen Kindern gehängt wurde.\n",
      "Nur weil sie die Versicherungssumme erhalten wollte.\n",
      "Und der häßlichste Mann in meiner Bekanntschaft ist ein Philantrop, der beinahe eine Viertelmillion an die Armen von London verteilt hat.«\n",
      "»In diesem Fall aber –«\n",
      "»Ich mache nie Ausnahmen.\n",
      "Eine Ausnahme widerlegt die Regel.\n",
      "Haben Sie je Gelegenheit gehabt, den Charakter eines Menschen anhand von Handschriften zu studieren?\n",
      "Was halten Sie vom Gekritzel dieses Burschen?«\n",
      "»Es ist lesbar und gleichförmig,« antwortete ich. »Ein Geschäftsmann mit charakterlicher Stärke.«\n",
      "Holmes schüttelte seinen Kopf.\n",
      "»Schauen Sie seine hohen Buchstaben an,« sagte er. »Sie erheben sich kaum über den Rest.\n",
      "Dieses d könnte ein a sein, und dieses l ein e. Männer von Charakter unterscheiden ihre hohen Buchstaben immer, wie unleserlich sie auch sonst schreiben mögen.\n",
      "Es gibt Schwankungen in seinen k's und Selbstbehauptung in seinen Großbuchstaben.\n",
      "Ich gehe jetzt spazieren.\n",
      "Ich habe einige Dinge zu erledigen.\n",
      "Ich empfehle Ihnen dieses Buch – eines der bemerkenswertesten, das je geschrieben wurden.\n",
      "Es ist Winwood Reades ›Martyrdom of Man‹.\n",
      "Ich werde in einer Stunde zurück sein.«\n",
      "Ich saß am Fenster mit dem Band in meiner Hand, aber meine Gedanken waren weit weg von den gewagten Spekulationen des Schriftstellers.\n",
      "Meine Gedanken waren bei unserer Besucherin – ihr Lächeln, die tiefen reichen Laute ihrer Stimme, das seltsame Rätsel, das ihr Leben überschattete.\n",
      "Wenn sie beim Verschwindens ihres Vaters siebzehn war, mußte sie jetzt siebenundzwanzig sein – ein süßes Alter, wenn die Befangenheit der Jugend verlorengeht und durch die Erfahrung abgelöst wird.\n",
      "So saß ich und grübelte, bis mir so gefährlichen Gedanken in den Kopf kamen, daß ich zu meinem Schreibtisch eilte und mich wütend in die neueste Abhandlung über Pathologie stürzte.\n",
      "Wer war ich schon, ein Armeechirurg mit einem lädierten Bein und einem ebenfalls lädierten Bankguthaben?\n",
      "Wie konnte ich es wagen, an so etwas zu denken?\n",
      "Sie war eine Größe, ein Faktor – nichts weiter.\n",
      "Sollte meine Zukunft dunkel erscheinen, so war es sicher besser, ihr wie ein Mann entgegen zu treten, als sie durch bloße Phantastereien aufzuwerten.\n",
      "Die Suche nach einer Lösung\n",
      "Es war halb sechs, als Holmes zurückkehrte.\n",
      "Er war heiter und lebhaft und in ausgezeichneter Verfassung – eine Stimmung, die sich bei ihm schnell mit Anfällen der schwärzesten Depression abwechseln kann.\n",
      "»Es gibt kein großes Rätsel in diesem Fall,« sagte er und nahm die Tasse Tee, die ich für ihn gefüllt hatte. »Die Tatsachen scheinen nur eine Erklärung zuzulassen.«\n",
      "»Was!\n",
      "Haben Sie es schon gelöst?«\n",
      "»Nun, das wäre zuviel gesagt.\n",
      "Ich habe eine einleuchtende Tatsache entdeckt, das ist alles.\n",
      "Sie ist aber sehr einleuchtend.\n",
      "Die Einzelheiten müssen aber noch hinzugefügt werden.\n",
      "Ich habe gerade beim Durchsuchen der früheren Ausgaben der Times herausgefunden, daß dieser Major Sholto aus Upper Norword, von der 34. Bombay Infanterie, am 28. April 1882 starb«.\n",
      "»Ich bin vielleicht sehr begriffsstutzig, Holmes, aber ich sehe nicht, was dies bedeuten soll.«\n",
      "»Nein?\n",
      "Sie überraschen mich.\n",
      "Schauen Sie es dann auf diese Art an.\n",
      "Kapitän Morstan verschwindet.\n",
      "Die einzige Person in London, die er besucht haben könnte, ist Major Sholto.\n",
      "Major Sholto bestreitet erfahren zu haben, daß Morstan in London war.\n",
      "Vier Jahre später stirbt Sholto.\n",
      "Nur eine Woche nach seinem Tod bekommt die Tochter von Kapitän Morstan ein wertvolles Geschenk, das von Jahr zu Jahr wiederholt wird und es gipfelt jetzt in einem Brief, der sie als betrogene Frau bezeichnet.\n",
      "Welches Unrecht kann gemeint sein, außer der Verlust ihres Vaters?\n",
      "Und warum sollten die Geschenke sofort nach Sholto's Tod anfangen, wenn nicht der Erbe dieses Sholto etwas von dem Rätsel wußte und Wiedergutmachung anstrebte?\n",
      "Haben Sie irgendeine andere Theorie, die die Tatsachen besser erklärt?«\n",
      "»Aber was für eine seltsame Wiedergutmachung!\n",
      "Und wie seltsam sie ausgeführt wird!\n",
      "Warum sollte er jetzt einen Brief schreiben, den er besser vor sechs Jahren geschrieben hätte?\n",
      "Außerdem spricht der Brief von ›Gerechtigkeit walten lassen‹.\n",
      "Welche Gerechtigkeit ist gemeint?\n",
      "Es ist nicht anzunehmen, daß ihr Vater noch lebt.\n",
      "Es gibt in diesem Fall keine andere Ungerechtigkeit.«\n",
      "»Es gibt Ungereimtheiten; es gibt sicher Ungereimtheiten,« sagte Sherlock Holmes nachdenklich. »Aber unser Ausflug heute abend wird sie alle klären.\n",
      "Ah, hier ist eine Droschke und Fräulein Morstan ist darin.\n",
      "Sind Sie bereit?\n",
      "Dann gehen wir besser hinunter, denn es ist doch spät geworden.«\n",
      "Ich nahm meinen Hut und meinen schwersten Stock.\n",
      "Ich sah wie Holmes seinen Revolver aus der Schublade nahm und ihn in seine Tasche steckte.\n",
      "Er dachte sicherlich, daß uns heute Nacht ernste Arbeit erwarten könnte.\n",
      "Fräulein Morstan war in einen dunklen Mantel gehüllt, und ihr empfindsames Gesicht war gefaßt, aber blaß.\n",
      "Sie wäre keine Frau gewesen, wenn sie nicht Unruhe bei diesem seltsamen Unternehmen gefühlt hätte, auf das wir uns jetzt einließen.\n",
      "Doch ihre Selbstbeherrschung war perfekt, und sie beantwortete bereitwillig die wenigen zusätzlichen Fragen, die Sherlock Holmes ihr stellte.\n",
      "»Major Sholto war ein besonderer Freund von Papa,« sagte sie. »Seine Briefe waren voll von Anspielungen über den Major.\n",
      "Er und Papa befehligten die Truppen auf den Andaman Inseln.\n",
      "Übrigens wurde ein seltsames Dokument in Papas Schreibtisch gefunden, das niemand verstehen konnte.\n",
      "Ich nehme nicht an, daß es von großer Wichtigkeit ist, aber ich dachte, Sie würden es gerne sehen.\n",
      "Deshalb habe ich es mitgebracht.\n",
      "Hier ist es.«\n",
      "Holmes entfaltete das Papier vorsichtig und glättete es auf seinem Knie.\n",
      "Dann untersuchte er es sehr methodisch mit seiner Lupe.\n",
      "»Es ist Papier aus indischer Herstellung,« bemerkte er. »Es war einmal an einem Brett angeheftet.\n",
      "Das dargestellte Diagramm scheint ein Plan vom Teil eines großen Gebäudes mit zahlreichen Hallen, Korridoren, und Durchgängen zu sein.\n",
      "An einer Stelle ist ein kleines Kreuz in roter Tinte, und über ihm steht in verblichener Bleistiftschrift ›3.37 von links‹.\n",
      "In der linken Ecke ist eine seltsame Hieroglyphe.\n",
      "Sie sieht aus wie vier Kreuze in einer Reihe, deren Arme sich berühren.\n",
      "Daneben steht in sehr steilen und rohen Buchstaben geschrieben ›Das Zeichen der Vier – Jonathan Small, Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan, Dost Akbar.\n",
      "‹ Nein, ich gestehe, ich kann nicht erkennen, wie uns dies hilft.\n",
      "Doch es ist augenscheinlich ein Dokument von Wichtigkeit.\n",
      "Es wurde sorgfältig in einer Brieftasche aufbewahrt; denn die eine Seite ist so sauber wie die andere.«\n",
      "»Wir fanden es in seiner Brieftasche.«\n",
      "»So bewahren Sie es sorgfältig auf, Fräulein Morstan, denn es könnte sich noch als nützlich herausstellen.\n",
      "Ich fange an zu glauben, daß diese Sache vielleicht viel tiefer und spitzfindiger sein könnte, als ich zuerst annahm.\n",
      "Ich muß meine Ideen noch einmal überdenken.« Er lehnte sich im Wagen zurück und ich konnte an seinen hochgezogenen Augenbrauen und an seinen Augen sehen, daß er konzentriert nachdachte.\n",
      "Fräulein Morstan und ich plauderten leise über unseren gegenwärtigen Ausflug und sein mögliches Ergebnis, aber unser Begleiter behielt seine undurchdringliche Reserviertheit bis an das Ende unserer Reise bei.\n",
      "Es war ein Septemberabend, und noch keine sieben Uhr, aber der Tag war düster gewesen, und ein dichter nieselnder Nebel lag über der großen Stadt.\n",
      "Schmutziggraue Wolken hingen traurig über den schlammigen Straßen.\n",
      "Entlang des Strandes standen Lampen, aber sie erzeugten nur neblige Kleckse von diffusem Licht und warfen einen schwachen kreisförmigen Schimmer auf dem schleimigen Bürgersteig.\n",
      "Das gleißend gelbe Licht der Schaufenster strahlte in die feuchte Luft und warf seine düsteren Strahlen in die überfüllte Durchfahrt.\n",
      "Die endlosen Prozession von Gesichtern in diesen Lichtkegeln hatten etwas unheimliches und geisterhaftes – traurige und frohe Gesichter, ausgezehrte und fröhliche.\n",
      "Wie alle menschlichen Wesen flattern sie von der Finsternis ins Licht, und zurück in die Finsternis.\n",
      "Ich bin nicht leicht zu beeindrucken, aber der trübe, feuchte Abend und das seltsame Vorhaben, auf das wir uns eingelassen hatten, reichten aus, um mich nervös und deprimiert zu machen.\n",
      "Ich konnte an Fräulein Morstan's Gesichtsausdruck erkennen, daß sie unter den gleichen Gefühlen litt.\n",
      "Nur Holmes konnte sich über solche geringfügigen Einflüsse hinwegsetzen.\n",
      "Er hielt sein offenes Notizbuch auf seinem Knie, und bisweilen notierte er Zahlen und Notizen im Licht seiner Taschenlampe.\n",
      "Vor dem Lyceum Theater standen die Menschenmengen schon in dicken Trauben an den Seiteneingängen.\n",
      "Am Eingang war das Klappern eines ununterbrochenen Stroms von zweirädrigen und vierrädrigen Droschken zu hören, die ihre Fracht von hemdgeschmückten Männern und diamantengeschmückten Frauen dort abluden.\n",
      "Wir hatten den dritten Pfeiler, der unser Rendezvouspunkt war, kaum erreicht, als uns ein kleiner, dunkler, lebhafter Mann in Kutscherkleidung ansprach.\n",
      "»Sind Sie die Begleitung von Fräulein Morstan?« fragte er.\n",
      "»Ich bin Fräulein Morstan, und diese zwei Gentlemen sind meine Freunde,« sagte sie.\n",
      "Er warf seine durchdringenden und fragenden Augen auf uns.\n",
      "»Sie müssen mich entschuldigen, Fräulein,« sagte er mit einer gewissen Beharrlichkeit, »aber ich soll Sie bitten, mir Ihr Wort zu geben, daß keiner Ihrer Begleiter Polizeioffizier ist.«\n",
      "»Ich gebe Ihnen darauf mein Wort,« antwortete sie.\n",
      "Er gab einen schrillen Pfiff ab, woraufhin ein Straßenjunge eine vierrädrige Droschke heranführte und die Tür öffnete.\n",
      "Der Mann, der uns angesprochen hatte, nahm auf dem Kutschersitz Platz, während wir unsere Plätze im Innern einnahmen.\n",
      "Wir waren kaum damit fertig, als der Fahrer auf sein Pferd einpeitschte und wir mit einem furiosen Tempo durch die nebligen Straßen schossen.\n",
      "Die Situation war merkwürdig.\n",
      "Wir fuhren zu einem unbekannten Ort und mit einem unbekannten Ziel.\n",
      "Doch entweder war unsere Einladung ein vollständiger Schwindel – eine unvorstellbare Hypothese – oder wir hatten guten Grund anzunehmen, daß auf unserer Reise wichtige Fragen beantwortet werden könnten.\n",
      "Fräulein Morstans Benehmen war resolut und gefaßter denn je.\n",
      "Ich bemühte mich, sie aufzuheitern und durch Erinnerungen meiner Abenteuer in Afghanistan zu amüsieren; aber, um die Wahrheit zu sagen, war ich selbst so aufgeregt und so neugierig auf das Ziel unserer Fahrt, daß meine Geschichten etwas kompliziert wurden.\n",
      "Bis heute behauptet sie, ich hätte ihr eine bewegende Geschichte erzählt, wie eine Muskete mitten in der Nacht in mein Zelt hineinzielte, und ich eine doppelläufige Tigerflinte darauf abfeuerte.\n",
      "Zuerst hatte ich noch ein Gefühl für die Richtung, in die wir fuhren; aber bald verlor ich die Orientierung, was unserem Tempo, dem Nebel, und meinen begrenzten Stadtkenntnissen von London zuzuschreiben war.\n",
      "So wußte ich nichts, außer, daß wir einen sehr langen Weg zu fahren schienen.\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes hingegen war nie unsicher und murmelte die Straßennamen, während die Droschke durch die Straßenblöcke und verwinkelten Seitenstraßen klapperte.\n",
      "»Rochester Row,« sagte er. »Jetzt Vincent Square.\n",
      "Jetzt kommen wir auf die Vauxhall Bridge Road.\n",
      "Anscheinend fahrend wir nach Surrey.\n",
      "Ja, ich habe es mir gedacht.\n",
      "Jetzt sind wir auf der Brücke.\n",
      "Sie können einen Blick auf den Fluß werfen.«\n",
      "Wir hatten tatsächlich einen flüchtigen Blick auf ein Stück der Themse werfen können, wo Lampen das breite, stille Wasser beschienen.\n",
      "Aber unsere Droschke preschte weiter, und gelangte bald in ein Labyrinth von Straßen auf der anderen Seite der Themse.\n",
      "»Wordsworth Road,« sagte mein Begleiter. »Priory Road.\n",
      "Lark Hall Lane.\n",
      "Stockwell Place.\n",
      "Robert Street.\n",
      "Cold Harbour Lane.\n",
      "Unser Unternehmen scheint uns nicht in sehr populäre Gebiete zu führen.\n",
      "Wir hatten tatsächlich eine fragwürdige und abschreckende Gegend erreicht.\n",
      "Lange Linien stumpfer Backsteinhäuser wurden nur vom groben blendenden Licht und kitschig-buntem Glanz öffentlicher Häuser an der Ecke erhellt.\n",
      "Dann kamen Reihen zweistöckiger Villen, jede mit einem kleinen Garten davor, und dann wieder endlose Reihen neuer starrer Backsteingebäude – die Monster-Tentakel, die die riesige Stadt in das Land warf.\n",
      "Endlich fuhr die Droschke an das dritte Haus einer neuen Häuserreihe.\n",
      "Keines der anderen Häuser war bewohnt, und dort wo wir hielten, war das Haus so dunkel wie die benachbarten, mit Ausnahme eines einzelnen Schimmers im Küchenfenster.\n",
      "Auf unser Klopfen aber wurde die Tür sofort von einem Hindu-Diener geöffnet.\n",
      "Er trug einen gelben Turban und war in weiße, locker getragene Tücher gekleidet, darum eine gelbe Schärpe.\n",
      "Es war irgend etwas merkwürdig und unpassend an dieser orientalischen Figur, die im Türrahmen dieses drittklassigen vorstädtischen Hauses stand.\n",
      "»Der Sahib erwartet Sie,« sagte er, und in dem Moment als er sprach, drang eine hohe, pfeifende Stimme aus irgendeinem Zimmer im Innern. »Zeigen Sie sie mir, khitmutgar,« rief die Stimme. »Bringen Sie sie direkt zu mir hinein.«\n",
      "Die Geschichte des kahlköpfigen Mannes\n",
      "Wir folgten dem Inder einen einfachen und heruntergekommenen Korridor entlang, der schlecht beleuchtet und noch schlechter möbliert war, bis wir an eine Tür zur Rechten gelangten, die er uns öffnete.\n",
      "Ein gelber Feuerschein fiel auf uns und im Zentrum des blendenden Lichtes stand ein kleiner Mann mit einer sehr hohen Stirn und einem kahlen, glänzenden Kopf, der, umgeben von einem Büschel fransiger roter Haare, wie ein Berggipfel aus einem Fichtenwald herausragte.\n",
      "Er presste seine Hände zusammen während er so stand und sein Gesichtsausdruck war in einem ständigen ruckhaften Wechsel begriffen; mal lächelnd, mal finster blickend, aber nie für einen Augenblick ruhig.\n",
      "Die Natur hatte ihn mit einer frei hängenden Lippe und einer Reihe gelber, unregelmäßiger Zähne ausgestattet.\n",
      "Er bemühte sich ständig, den unteren Teil seines Gesichtes zu verbergen, indem er ihn mit Handbewegungen zu verdecken suchte.\n",
      "Trotz seiner auffälligen Kahlheit erweckte er den Eindruck von Jugend.\n",
      "Tatsächlich war er gerade dreissig geworden.\n",
      "»Zu Ihren Diensten, Miss Morstan,« wiederholte er in einer dünnen, hohen Stimme. »Zu Ihren Diensten, Gentlemen.\n",
      "Bitte treten Sie in mein kleines Allerheiligstes ein.\n",
      "Ein kleiner Ort, Miss, aber nach meinem eigenen Geschmack eingerichtet.\n",
      "Eine Oase der Kunst in der heulenden Wüste von Süd-London.«\n",
      "Wir waren alle über das Aussehen der Wohnung erstaunt, in die er uns nun einlud.\n",
      "In diesem traurigen Haus war sie so fehl am Platze wie ein Diamant erster Qualität in einer Fassung aus Messing.\n",
      "Die wertvollsten und glänzendsten Vorhänge und Gobelins drapierten die Wände, hier und da zurückgeschlagen, um irgendein kunstvoll gerahmtes Gemälde oder eine Vase freizulegen.\n",
      "Der Teppich war bernsteinfarben und schwarz gemustert und so dick, daß der Fuß darin angenehm wie in ein Bett von Moos einsank.\n",
      "Zwei große Tigerfelle, die quer darüberlagen, vergrößerten den Eindruck von orientalischem Luxus, ebenso wie eine große Wasserpfeife, die auf einer Matte in der Ecke stand.\n",
      "Eine Lampe in Form einer silbernen Taube hing von einen fast unsichtbaren goldenen Draht in der Mitte des Zimmers.\n",
      "Sie war angezündet und füllte die Luft mit einem feinen und aromatischen Duft.\n",
      "»Mr.\n",
      "Thaddeus Sholto«, sagte der kleine Mann, immer noch zuckend und lächelnd. »So heiße ich.\n",
      "Sie sind natürlich Miss Morstan.\n",
      "Und diese Gentlemen –«\n",
      "»Dies ist Mr. Sherlock Holmes, und dies ist Dr. Watson.«\n",
      "»Ein Arzt, hä?« rief er aufgeregt. »Haben Sie Ihr Stethoskop dabei?\n",
      "Darf ich Sie fragen – würden Sie die Freundlichkeit besitzen?\n",
      "Ich habe ernste Sorgen um meine Herzklappen, wenn Sie daher so freundlich wären.\n",
      "Auf die eine kann ich mich verlassen, aber ich würde Ihre Meinung über die andere gerne hören.«\n",
      "Ich hörte sein Herz wie gebeten ab, konnte aber nichts Besonderes finden, außer, daß er von außerordentlicher Angst erfüllt war, denn er zitterte von Kopf bis Fuß.\n",
      "»Alles scheint normal zu sein«, sagte ich, »Sie haben keinen Grund zur Besorgnis.«\n",
      "»Bitte entschuldigen Sie meine Sorge, Miss Morstan,« bemerkte er entschuldigend. »Ich bin stark leidend, und ich habe schon lange die Herzklappe im Verdacht gehabt.\n",
      "Ich bin aber erfreut zu hören, daß dies nicht der Fall ist.\n",
      "Wenn Ihr Vater, Miss Morgan, aufgehört hätte sein Herz so stark zu belasten, könnte er heute noch leben.«\n",
      "Ich hätte dem Mann gerne ins Gesicht geschlagen, so erzürnt war ich über diese gefühllose offene Erwähnung einer doch Zartgefühl erfordernden Angelegenheit.\n",
      "Miss Morstan setzte sich und ihr Gesicht wurde ebenso weiß wie ihre Lippen.\n",
      "»Ich wußte tief im Herzen, daß er tot ist«, sagte sie.\n",
      "»Ich kann Ihnen alle Informationen geben,« sagte er, »und mehr noch, ich kann Ihnen zu Ihrem Recht verhelfen.\n",
      "Das werde ich tun, egal was Bruder Bartholomew vielleicht sagen wird.\n",
      "Ich bin so froh, Ihre Freunde hier zu haben, nicht nur als Ihren Geleitschutz, sondern auch als Zeugen dessen, was ich nun tun und sagen werde.\n",
      "Drei von uns können sich gegen Bruder Bartholomew durchsetzen.\n",
      "Aber wir wollen keine Außenstehenden, keine Polizei oder Beamte.\n",
      "Wir können alles unter uns und ohne Einmischung anderer zufriedenstellend regeln.\n",
      "Nichts würde Bruder Bartholomew mehr ärgern als irgendeine Öffentlichkeit.« Er setzte sich auf eine niedrige Couch und blinzelte uns fragend mit seinen schwachen, wäßrigen blauen Augen an.\n",
      "»Was mich angeht,« sagte Holmes, »was immer sie erzählen, ich werde es nicht weitergeben.«\n",
      "Ich nickte, um meine Zustimmung zu zeigen.\n",
      "»Das ist gut!\n",
      "Das ist gut!« sagte er. »Miss Morstan, darf ich Ihnen ein Glas Chianti anbieten?\n",
      "Oder Tokayer?\n",
      "Ich habe keine anderen Weine.\n",
      "Soll ich eine Flasche öffnen?\n",
      "Nein?\n",
      "Nun, dann hoffe ich, daß Sie nichts gegen Tabakrauch einzuwenden haben, gegen den milden balsamischen Duft der orientalischen Tabake.\n",
      "Ich bin ein wenig nervös und halte meine Wasserpfeife für ein unbezahlbares Beruhigungsmittel.« Er nahm eine dünne Wachskerze zum Entzünden des Pfeifenkopfes und der Rauch blubberte fröhlich durch das Rosenwasser.\n",
      "Wir drei saßen im Halbkreis, die Köpfe vorgeneigt und das Kinn in die Hände gestützt, während der seltsame, zappelige kleine Kerl mit seinem hohen, schimmernden Kopf verlegen in der Mitte paffte.\n",
      "»Als ich mich entschloß, dieses Gespräch mit Ihnen zu führen,« sagte er, »hätte ich Ihnen meine Adresse geben können, aber ich fürchtete, daß Sie meine Bitte ignorieren und unerfreuliche Leute mit sich bringen könnten.\n",
      "Daher nahm ich mir die Freiheit, die Verabredung dergestalt zu arrangieren, daß mein Mann Williams Sie zuerst treffen konnte.\n",
      "Ich habe volles Vertrauen in seine Diskretion und er hatte den Auftrag, die Sache nicht weiter zu verfolgen, sollte er enttäuscht werden.\n",
      "Sie müssen diese Vorsichtsmaßnahme entschuldigen, aber ich lebe sehr zurückgezogen und habe vielleicht einen seltsamen Geschmack, aber es gibt nichts unästhetischeres als einen Polizisten.\n",
      "Ich habe eine natürliche Abneigung gegen alle Formen von rohem Materialismus.\n",
      "Ich komme selten mit rohen Menschen zusammen.\n",
      "Wie Sie sehen, lebe ich mit einer gewissen Atmosphäre von Eleganz um mich herum.\n",
      "Ich könnte mich als einen Liebhaber der Künste bezeichnen.\n",
      "Das ist meine Schwäche.\n",
      "Das Landschaftsgemälde ist ein echter Corot, und obgleich ein Kenner vielleicht Zweifel an diesem Salvator Rosa haben könnte, es gibt keinen Zweifel über den Bougereau.\n",
      "Ich habe eine Vorliebe für die moderne französische Schule.«\n",
      "»Bitte entschuldigen Sie, Mr. Sholto,« sagte Miss Morstan, »aber ich bin auf Ihre Bitte hierher gekommen, um etwas zu erfahren, daß Sie mir mitteilen möchten.\n",
      "Es ist sehr spät und ich wünsche, daß das Gespräch so kurz wie möglich wird.«\n",
      "»Auf jeden Fall braucht es einige Zeit,« antwortete er, »denn wir werden sicherlich nach Norwood fahren müssen, um Bruder Bartholomew zu treffen.\n",
      "Wir werden gemeinsam fahren und sehen, ob wir ihn in guter Laune finden.\n",
      "Er ist sehr verärgert über den von mir eingeschlagenen Kurs, obwohl er mir richtig erscheint.\n",
      "Ich hatte gestern kräftigen Streit mit ihm.\n",
      "Sie können sich nicht vorstellen, was für ein schrecklicher Kerl er ist, wenn er böse ist.«\n",
      "»Falls wir nach Norwood fahren müssen, sollten wir auch sofort aufbrechen,« wagte ich zu bemerken.\n",
      "Er lachte und seine Ohren wurden ganz rot.\n",
      "»Das würde kaum gehen«, rief er, »ich weiß nicht, was er sagen würde, wenn ich Sie auf diese abrupte Weise hereinbrächte.\n",
      "Nein, ich muß Sie darauf vorbereiten, indem ich Ihnen erkläre, wie wir alle zueinander stehen.\n",
      "Zuerst muß ich Ihnen sagen, daß es mehrere Punkte in der Geschichte gibt, die ich ausgelassen habe.\n",
      "Ich kann Ihnen nur die Tatsachen erzählen, die ich selber weiß.«\n",
      "»Wie Sie vermutlich bereits erraten haben, war mein Vater Major Sholto, er war früher in der Armee in Indien.\n",
      "Er ging vor etwa elf Jahren in Pension und wollte bei Pondicherry Lodge in Upper Norwood leben.\n",
      "Er war in Indien wohlhabend geworden und brachte eine beträchtliche Summe Geldes mit zurück, auch eine große Sammlung wertvoller Kostbarkeiten sowie sein Personal von indischen Dienern.\n",
      "Er kaufte sich ein Haus und lebte in großem Luxus.\n",
      "Mein Zwillingsbruder Bartholomew und ich waren die einzigen Kinder.«\n",
      "»Ich erinnere mich sehr gut an die Aufregung, die das Verschwinden von Kapitän Morstan verursachte.\n",
      "Wir lasen die Einzelheiten in den Zeitungen, und diskutierten den Fall offen in seiner Anwesenheit, da er ein Freund unseres Vaters gewesen war.\n",
      "Gewöhnlich beteiligte er sich an unseren Spekulationen über das, was geschehen sein könnte.\n",
      "In keinster Weise hätten wir vermutet, das er das ganze Geheimnis in seiner Brust versteckt hielt – daß von allen Menschen er allein das Schicksal von Arthur Morstan kannte.«\n",
      "»Wir wußten jedoch, daß irgendein Rätsel – eine bestimmte Gefahr – unseren Vater beschäftigte.\n",
      "Er war sehr ängstlich, alleine das Haus zu verlassen und er beschäftigte immer zwei Preiskämpfer, die als Pförtner in der Pondicherry Lodge arbeiteten.\n",
      "Williams, der sie heute nacht fuhr, ist einer von ihnen.\n",
      "Er war einmal englischer Leichtgewicht-Meister.\n",
      "Unser Vater hätte uns nie von seinen Ängsten erzählt, aber er hatte eine deutliche Abneigung gegen Männern mit Holzbeinen.\n",
      "Einmal feuerte er seinen Revolver auf einen Mann mit Holzbein ab, der sich später als ein einfacher Händler auf der Suche nach Aufträgen erwies.\n",
      "Wir mußten eine große Summe zahlen, um die Sache zu vertuschen.\n",
      "Mein Bruder und ich haben früher gedacht, dies sei eine bloße Laune meines Vaters, aber die Ereignisse seitdem haben uns dazu gebracht, unsere Meinung zu ändern.«\n",
      "»Anfang 1882 erhielt mein Vater einen Brief aus Indien, der für ihn ein großer Schock war.\n",
      "Als er ihn öffnete, fiel er beinahe am Frühstückstisch in Ohnmacht und seit diesem Tag kränkelte er, bis zu seinem Tode.\n",
      "Wir konnten nie herausfinden, was in diesem Brief stand.\n",
      "Aber als er ihn in Händen hielt, konnte ich sehen, daß er kurz und in einer kritzeligen Handschrift geschrieben war.\n",
      "Er hatte jahrelang an einer vergrößerten Milz gelitten, aber es ging jetzt schneller mit ihm bergab.\n",
      "Ende April wurden wir informiert, daß er jenseits aller Hoffnung war, und daß er eine letzte Unterredung mit uns führen wollte.«\n",
      "»Als wir sein Zimmer betraten, lag er von Kissen gestützt und das Atmen fiel ihm schwer.\n",
      "Er flehte uns an, die Tür abzuschließen und an beiden Seite des Bettes Platz zu nehmen.\n",
      "Dann ergriff er unsere Hände und machte er uns eine bemerkenswerte Eröffnung in einer Stimme, die von Emotion wie auch von Schmerz gezeichnet war.\n",
      "Ich werde versuchen, es Ihnen in seinen eigenen Worten zu erzählen.«\n",
      "›Es gibt nur eine Sache,‹ sagte er, ›die mir in diesem Moment auf der Seele liegt.\n",
      "Es ist die Art, wie ich Morstan's arme Waise behandelt habe.\n",
      "Aus Gier, meiner schlimmsten Sünde im Leben, habe ich ihr den Schatz vorenthalten, der ihr eigentlich mindestens zur Hälfte zusteht.\n",
      "Obwohl ich selbst keinen Gebrauch davon gemacht habe – so blind und dumm ist die Habgier.\n",
      "Das bloße Gefühl von Besitz war mir soviel wert, daß ich es nicht ertragen konnte, mit jemandem zu teilen.\n",
      "Seht ihr den mit Perlen besetzten Rosenkranz neben der Chininflasche.\n",
      "Obwohl ich es nicht ertrug zu teilen, hatte ich ihn mitgebracht, um ihn ihr zu schicken.\n",
      "Ihr, meine Söhne, sollt ihr einen angemessenen Anteil vom Schatz des Agra geben.\n",
      "Aber schickt ihr nichts – auch nicht den Kranz – ehe ich gegangen bin.\n",
      "Denn es sind schon andere so krank gewesen wie ich, und dennoch genesen.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "›Ich will euch erzählen, wie Morstan starb,‹ fuhr er fort.\n",
      "›Er hatte jahrelang an einem schwachen Herzen gelitten, aber er verbarg es vor jedem.\n",
      "Ich allein wußte es.\n",
      "Als er und ich in Indien waren, kamen wir durch eine bemerkenswerte Kette von Umständen in den Besitz eines beträchtlichen Schatzes.\n",
      "Ich brachte ihn mit zurück nach England.\n",
      "In der Nacht, in der Morstan zurückkehrte, kam er geradewegs hierher und verlangte seinen Anteil.\n",
      "Er kam direkt vom Bahnhof und wurde von meinem treuen Lal Chowdar empfangen, der jetzt tot ist.\n",
      "Morstan und ich waren unterschiedlicher Meinung über die Teilung des Schatzes und es fielen hitzige Worte.\n",
      "Morstan war gerade in einem Anfall von Ärger aus seinem Stuhl aufgesprungen, als er seine Hand plötzlich an die Seite drückte.\n",
      "Sein Gesicht nahm eine dunkle Farbe an und er fiel rückwärts hin und stieß mit seinem Kopf an die Ecke der Schatzkiste.\n",
      "Als ich mich über ihn beugte, stellte ich zu meinem Schrecken fest, daß er tot war.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "›Längere Zeit saß ich völlig abwesend da und überlegte, was zu tun sei.\n",
      "Natürlich war mein erster Gedanke, Hilfe zu holen.\n",
      "Aber ich konnte auch klar erkennen, daß es sehr wahrscheinlich war, daß ich des Mordes an ihm angeklagt würde.\n",
      "Sein Tod während eines Streites und die klaffende Wunde an seinem Kopf, beides würde gegen mich sprechen.\n",
      "Zudem könnte eine offizielle Untersuchung nicht angestellt werden, ohne einige Tatsachen über den Schatz ans Licht zu bringen, den ich doch geheim halten wollte.\n",
      "Er hatte mir gesagt, daß kein Mensch auf dieser Welt wüßte, wohin er gegangen sei.\n",
      "So gab es auch keine Notwendigkeit, daß es ein Mensch je erfahren sollte.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "›Ich dachte immer noch über die Sache nach, als ich beim Hochblicken meinen Diener Lal Chowdar in der Türöffnung sah.\n",
      "Er stahl sich herein und verriegelte die Tür hinter sich.\n",
      "'Fürchten Sie nichts, Sahib,' sagte er.\n",
      "'Niemand braucht zu wissen, daß Sie ihn getötet haben. Wir werden ihn verstecken und wer sollte dann etwas erfahren?' 'Ich habe ihn nicht getötet,' sagte ich.\n",
      "Lal Chowdar schüttelte seinen Kopf und lächelte.\n",
      "'Ich habe alles gehört, Sahib,' sagte er.\n",
      "'Ich habe Ihren Streit gehört und ich habe den Schlag gehört. Aber meine Lippen sind versiegelt. Alle im Haus schlafen. Wir sollten ihn gemeinsam fortbringen'.\n",
      "Das gab für mich den Ausschlag.\n",
      "Wenn mein eigener Diener nicht an meine Unschuld glaubte, wie konnte ich dann hoffen, es vor zwölf dummen Händlern auf der Geschworenenbank zu schaffen?\n",
      "Lal Chowdar und ich entledigten uns noch in der gleichen Nacht der Leiche und innerhalb weniger Tage waren die Londoner Zeitungen voll vom mysteriösen Verschwinden von Kapitän Morstan.\n",
      "Ihr seht, daß ich kaum Schuld an dieser Sache trage.\n",
      "Mein einziger Fehler war, daß wir nicht nur die Leiche, sondern auch die Schatzkiste verbargen.\n",
      "Und daß ich mich sowohl an Morstans als auch an meinen eigenen Anteil klammerte.\n",
      "Ich möchte daher, daß ihr das wiedergutmacht.\n",
      "Legt eure Ohren an meinen Mund.\n",
      "Der Schatz ist im – –‹ In diesem Moment überkam eine schreckliche Veränderung seinen Gesichtsausdruck, wild starrten seine Augen, sein Unterkiefer fiel herunter und er schrie in einer Stimme, die ich niemals vergessen werde, ›laßt ihn nicht herein!\n",
      "Um Gottes Willen, laßt ihm nicht herein!\n",
      "‹ Wir drehten unsere Köpfe zum Fenster hinter uns, an dem sein Blick hing.\n",
      "Ein Gesicht sah aus der Dunkelheit zu uns hinein.\n",
      "Wir konnten das Weiße auf der Nase sehen, dort wo sie gegen das Glas gepreßt wurde.\n",
      "Es war ein bärtiges, behaartes Gesicht, mit wilden, grausamen Augen und einem Ausdruck geballter Boshaftigkeit.\n",
      "Mein Bruder und ich hetzten zum Fenster, aber der Mann war fort.\n",
      "Als wir zum Vater zurückkamen, war sein Kopf herabgesunken und sein Puls hatte aufgehört zu schlagen.\n",
      "Wir durchsuchten in der Nacht den Garten, fanden aber kein Zeichen des Eindringlings außer einem einzelnen Fußabdruck, der genau unter dem Fenster im Blumenbeet sichtbar war.\n",
      "Ohne diese Spur hätten wir geglaubt, daß uns unsere Phantasie dieses wilde, grausame Gesicht heraufbeschworen hatte.\n",
      "Wir fanden jedoch bald einen weiteren und schlagkräftigeren Beweis, daß geheime Kräfte um uns herum am Wirken waren.\n",
      "Das Fenster im Zimmer meines Vaters wurde am Morgen offen vorgefunden, seine Schränke und seine Kisten waren geplündert worden, und auf seiner Brust war ein zerrissenes Stück Papier befestigt, mit den Worten ›Das Zeichen der Vier‹ bekritzelt.\n",
      "Was dieser Satz bedeutete oder wer unser geheimer Besucher war, haben wir nie erfahren.\n",
      "Soweit wir es beurteilen können, war nichts vom Besitz meines Vaters gestohlen worden, obwohl alles gründlich durchsucht worden war.\n",
      "Mein Bruder und ich brachten dieses Ereignis natürlich mit seiner Furcht in Verbindung, die ihn sein ganzes Leben lang verfolgt hatte.\n",
      "Aber es ist dennoch ein vollkommenes Rätsel für uns.«\n",
      "Der kleine Mann hielt inne, um seine Wasserpfeife erneut anzuzünden und paffte einige Momente gedankenvoll.\n",
      "Wir hatten alle vertieft dagesessen und seiner außergewöhnlichen Erzählung gelauscht.\n",
      "Bei der kurzen Beschreibung über den Tod ihres Vaters wurde Miss Morstan totenbleich und für einen Moment dachte ich, sie würde ohnmächtig werden.\n",
      "Sie erholte sich jedoch, nachdem sie ein Glas Wasser trank, das ich vorsichtig für sie aus einer venezianischen Karaffe auf dem Beitisch einfüllte.\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes saß mit gefaßtem Gesicht zurückgelehnt in seinem Stuhl, seine Lider verschlossen fast die Augen.\n",
      "Als ich zu ihm hinüberblickte, konnte ich kaum glauben, daß er sich heute noch bitterlich über das gewöhnliche Leben beklagt hatte.\n",
      "Hier zumindest war ein Problem, das seinen Scharfsinn auf das äußerste forderte.\n",
      "Mr. Thaddeus Sholto schaute jeden von uns mit offensichtlichem Stolz an und freute sich über den Effekt, den die Geschichte bei uns erzeugt hatte.\n",
      "Zwischen zwei Zügen aus seiner übergroßen Pfeife begann er fortzufahren.\n",
      "»Mein Bruder und ich,« sagte er, »waren sehr erregt über den Schatz, von dem mein Vater gesprochen hatte.\n",
      "Wochen und Monate gruben wir und versuchten uns in jedem Teil des Gartens, ohne aber seinen Verbleib zu entdecken.\n",
      "Es ärgerte uns zu wissen, daß er das Versteck genau in dem Moment auf seinen Lippen hatte, als er starb.\n",
      "Wir konnten die Pracht der vermißten Reichtümer durch den Kranz beurteilen, den er herausgenommen hatte.\n",
      "Über diesen Kranz hatten mein Bruder Bartholomew und ich eine kleine Diskussion.\n",
      "Die Perlen waren augenscheinlich von großem Wert, und er war nicht willens, sich von ihnen zu trennen.\n",
      "Unter Freunden: mein Bruder hatte eine ähnliche Schwäche wie mein Vater.\n",
      "Er meinte auch, daß es Anlaß zu Gerüchten geben und uns schließlich in Schwierigkeiten bringen könnte, wenn wir uns von dem Kranz trennen würden.\n",
      "Alles was ich tun konnte, war ihn zu überreden, mich Miss Morstan's Adresse herausfinden zu lassen und ihr eine einzelne Perle in regelmäßigen Abständen zuzusenden, damit sie wenigstens keine Not leiden müßte.\n",
      "»Das war ein netter Gedanke,« sagte unsere Begleiterin, »Sie sind sehr gutherzig«.\n",
      "Der kleine Mann machte eine geringschätzige Handbewegung.\n",
      "»Wir waren Ihre Treuhänder,« sagte er. »Das war der Standpunkt, den ich dabei vertrat, obwohl Bruder Bartholomew es so nicht sehen wollte.\n",
      "Wir selbst hatten viel Geld.\n",
      "Ich wünschte kein weiteres mehr.\n",
      "Außerdem wäre es schlechter Stil gewesen, eine junge Dame so gemein zu behandeln.\n",
      "›Le mauvais goût mène au crime.\n",
      "‹ Die Franzosen drücken dies sehr schön aus.\n",
      "Unser Meinungsunterschied über das Thema ging so weit, daß ich es für das beste hielt, ein eigenes Zimmer zu beziehen.\n",
      "Deshalb verließ ich Pondicherry Lodge und nahm den alten khitmutgar und Williams mit mir.\n",
      "Gestern aber erfuhr ich, daß etwas äußerst Wichtiges passiert ist.\n",
      "Der Schatz wurde entdeckt.\n",
      "Ich schrieb sofort an Miss Morstan, und es bleibt uns jetzt nur, nach Norwood zu fahren und unseren Anteil zu fordern.\n",
      "Ich habe gestern abend Bruder Bartholomew meine Ansicht dargelegt: wir werden deshalb erwartete, nicht aber willkommene Besucher sein«.\n",
      "Thaddeus Sholto stoppte und saß zuckend auf seiner luxuriösen Couch.\n",
      "Wir schwiegen alle, mit unseren Gedanken bei der neuen Entwicklung, die nun das mysteriöse Unternehmen genommen hatte.\n",
      "Holmes war der erste, der aufsprang.\n",
      "»Das haben Sie gut gemacht, Sir, von Anfang bis Ende,« sagte er. »Es ist möglich, daß wir uns revanchieren können, indem wir etwas Licht auf das werfen, was für Sie noch immer im Dunkeln liegt.\n",
      "Aber, wie Fräulein Morstan eben bemerkte, ist es spät, und wir sollten die Sache ohne Aufschub angehen.«\n",
      "Unser neuer Freund wickelte den Schlauch der Wasserpfeife bedachtsam auf, und holte hinter einem Vorhang einen sehr langen Mantel mit Verschlußkordeln, Astrakhan-Kragen und Manschetten hervor.\n",
      "Er knöpfte ihn trotz der nächtlichen Stunde fest zu und beendete sein Ankleiden mit dem Aufsetzen einer Kaninchenfell-Mütze, deren Klappen die Ohren bedeckten, so daß außer seinem spitzen Gesicht nichts von ihm zu sehen war.\n",
      "»Meine Gesundheit ist etwas angegriffen,« bemerkte er, als er uns den Korridor entlang führte. »Ich bin gezwungen, mich wie ein Hypochonder zu benehmen.«\n",
      "Die Droschke erwartete uns draußen und unser Vorgehen war augenscheinlich vorher arrangiert worden.\n",
      "Der Fahrer startete sofort und fuhr ein schnelles Tempo.\n",
      "Thaddeus Sholto redete unablässig mit einer Stimme, die sich hoch über dem Rasseln der Räder erhob.\n",
      "»Bartholomew ist ein kluger Kerl,« sagte er. »Was glauben Sie, wie er den Ort des Schatzes herausgefunden hat?\n",
      "Er war zu der Überzeugung gelangt, daß er sich irgendwo drinnen befinden müsse.\n",
      "Daher berechnete er den gesamten Rauminhalt des Hauses und maß überall nach, damit nicht ein Zoll fehlte.\n",
      "So stellte er unter anderem fest, daß die Höhe des Gebäudes vierundsiebzig Fuß betrug, aber beim Zusammenzählen der Deckenhöhen aller Zimmer und bei Berücksichtigung der Zwischeräume, die er durch Bohrungen ermittelte, kam er in der Summe nicht über siebzig Fuß.\n",
      "Es fehlten vier Fuß in der Rechnung.\n",
      "Diese konnten sich nur im Dachgiebel befinden.\n",
      "Deshalb schlug er ein Loch in die Stroh- und Gipsdecke des höchsten Zimmers und dort endlich fand er eine kleine Dachstube, die versiegelt und niemandem bekannt gewesen war.\n",
      "In der Mitte stand, auf zwei Dachsparren ruhend, die Schatztruhe.\n",
      "Er ließ sie durch das Loch hinab, und dort lag sie.\n",
      "Er schätzt den Wert der Edelsteine auf nicht weniger als eine halbe Million Sterling.«\n",
      "Bei der Erwähnung dieser gigantischen Summe starrten wir einander mit aufgerissenen Augen an.\n",
      "Falls wir den Anspruch von Miss Morstan sichern konnten, würde aus einer bedürftigen Gouvernante die reichste Erbin in England.\n",
      "Sicher sollte sich ein loyaler Freund über eine solche Nachricht freuen; ich muß aber beschämt sagen, daß mich Selbstsucht packte und daß mir mein Herz so schwer wie Blei wurde.\n",
      "Ich stotterte einige Worte des Glückwunsches, ließ den Kopf hängen und war für das Gebrabbel unseres neuen Freundes taub.\n",
      "Er war eindeutig ein überzeugter Hypochonder und ich vernahm wie im Traum, daß er endlose Reihen von Symptomen hervorbrachte und mich über die Zusammensetzung und Wirkung verschiedener Quacksalbereien befragte, von denen er einige in seiner Ledertasche mit sich führte.\n",
      "Ich hoffe, daß er sich an keinen meiner Ratschläge erinnern kann, die ich ihm in jener Nacht gab.\n",
      "Holmes sagt, er hätte zufällig mitbekommen, wie ich vor der großen Gefahr der Einnahme von mehr als zwei Tropfen Rizinusöl warnte, während ich ihm Strychnin in großen Dosen als ein Beruhigungsmittel empfahl.\n",
      "Wie auch immer, ich war sichtlich erleichtert, als unsere Droschke mit einem Ruck anhielt, und der Kutscher hinuntersprang, um die Tür zu öffnen.\n",
      "»Dies, Miss Morstan, ist Pondicherry Lodge,« sagte Thaddeus Sholto, als er ihr beim Aussteigen half.\n",
      "Die Tragödie von Pondicherry Lodge\n",
      "Es war beinahe elf Uhr, als wir diesen letzten Punkt unseres nächtlichen Abenteuers erreichten.\n",
      "Wir hatten den klammen Nebel der großen Stadt hinter uns gelassen, und die Nacht war ganz angenehm.\n",
      "Ein warmer Wind blies aus Westen und schwere Wolken bewegten sich langsam über den Himmel; der Halbmond lugte gelegentlich durch die Wolkenlücken.\n",
      "Es war klar genug, um auf irgendeine Entfernung alles zu erkennen, aber Thaddeus Sholto nahm eine der Seitenlaternen der Kutsche herunter, um uns ein besseres Licht auf unserem Weg zu geben.\n",
      "Pondicherry Lodge stand auf einem eigenen Grundstück und war rundum von einer sehr hohen Steinmauer umgeben, die überall mit Glassplittern besetzt war.\n",
      "Eine einzelne schmale eisenbeschlagene Tür bildete den einzigen Eingang.\n",
      "An diese klopfte unser Führer mit dem Tak-Tak eines Briefträgers.\n",
      "»Wer ist dort?« rief eine schroffe Stimme aus den Innern.\n",
      "»Ich bin's, McMurdo.\n",
      "Sie haben mich sicher am Klopfen erkannt.«\n",
      "Es kam eine nörgelige Stimme und man hörte das Klingeln und Klappern von Schlüsseln.\n",
      "Die Tür wurde weit zurückgeschwungen und ein kleiner Mann mit eingefallener Brust stand in der Öffnung.\n",
      "Das gelbe Licht seiner Laterne schien auf sein hervorgestrecktes Gesicht und seine blinzelnden mißtrauischen Augen.\n",
      "»Sie sind es, Mr. Thaddeus?\n",
      "Aber wer sind die anderen?\n",
      "Ich habe keinen Anweisungen über sie vom Herrn erhalten.«\n",
      "»Nein, McMurdo?\n",
      "Sie überraschen mich!\n",
      "Ich erzählte meinen Bruder gestern abend, daß ich einige Freunde mitbringen werde.«\n",
      "»Er ist heute nicht aus seinem Zimmer herausgekommen, Mr. Thaddeus.\n",
      "Und ich habe keine Anweisungen.\n",
      "Sie wissen selbst sehr gut, daß ich mich an die Regeln halten muß.\n",
      "Sie kann ich hereinlassen, aber Ihre Freunde müssen bleiben, wo sie sind.«\n",
      "Dies war ein unerwartetes Hindernis.\n",
      "Thaddeus Sholto sah ihn in einer perplexen und hilflosen Weise an.\n",
      "»Schlimm für Sie, McMurdo,« sagte er. »Wenn ich für sie bürge, muß Ihnen das genügen.\n",
      "Hier ist auch eine junge Dame.\n",
      "Sie kann um diese Zeit nicht auf einer öffentlichen Straße warten.«\n",
      "»Es tut mir sehr leid, Mr. Thaddeus,« sagte der Pförtner unerbitterlich, »Die Leute mögen Ihre Freunde sein, aber nicht die Freunde des Herrn.\n",
      "Ich werde für meine Pflichten gut bezahlt und ich tue meine Pflicht.\n",
      "Ich kenne keinen Ihrer Freunde.«\n",
      "»Aber sicher kennen Sie jemanden, McMurdo,« rief Sherlock Holmes erfreut, »Ich glaube nicht, daß Sie mich vergessen haben.\n",
      "Erinnern Sie sich nicht an den Amateur, der drei Runden mit Ihnen bei Alison's kämpfte, etwa vor vier Jahren?«\n",
      "»Nein wirklich, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,« brüllte der Preisboxer. »Bei Gott!\n",
      "Wie konnte ich Sie nicht erkennen?\n",
      "Wenn Sie dort nicht so ruhig stünden und mir statt dessen ein Paar Ihrer Schwinger unter das Kinn gäben, hätte ich Sie ohne Frage erkannt.\n",
      "Oh, Sie sind jemand, der seine Künste verschwendet!\n",
      "Sie wären weit gekommen, wenn Sie weitergemacht hätten.«\n",
      "»Sehen Sie, Watson, wenn alle Künste versagen, steht mir immer noch einer der wissenschaftlichen Berufe offen,« sagte Holmes lachend. »Unser Freund wird uns nun nicht in der Kälte stehen lassen, da bin ich sicher.«\n",
      "»Kommen Sie herein!\n",
      "Herein mit Ihnen, Sir!\n",
      "Sie und Ihre Freunde,« antwortete er. »Entschuldigen Sie, Mr. Thaddeus, aber die Anweisungen sind sehr streng.\n",
      "Ich muß mir über Ihre Freunde Sicherheit verschaffen, bevor ich sie hereinlassen kann.«\n",
      "Im Innern wand sich ein Kieselsteinweg durch die triste Umgebung und führte zu einem mächtigen, quadratischen Haus, das, bis auf einen Mondstrahl, der sich ein einem Dachfenster spiegelte, in Schatten gehüllt war.\n",
      "Die gewaltige Größe des Gebäudes, seine Düsternis und seine tödliche Stille erzeugten eine Kälte im Herzen.\n",
      "Auch Thaddeus Sholto schien leicht bedrückt und die Laterne zitterte und klapperte in seiner Hand.\n",
      "»Ich kann es nicht verstehen,« sagte er. »Es muß irgendeinen Irrtum geben.\n",
      "Ich erzählte Bartholomew ausdrücklich, daß wir hier sein werden, und doch gibt es kein Licht in seinem Fenster.\n",
      "Ich weiß nicht, was ich davon halten soll.«\n",
      "»Beschützt er die Räumlichkeiten immer auf diese Art?« fragte Holmes.\n",
      "»Ja; er ist der Sitte meines Vaters gefolgt.\n",
      "Er war der Lieblingssohn, wie Sie wissen, und ich glaube manchmal, daß mein Vater ihm vielleicht mehr erzählt hat, als er mir je erzählte.\n",
      "Das ist Bartholomews Fenster, dort wo der Mondschein hinfällt.\n",
      "Es ist ganz hell, aber es gibt im Innern kein Licht, denke ich«.\n",
      "»Nichts,« sagte Holmes. »Aber ich sehe den Schimmer eines Lichtes in dem kleinen Fenster neben der Tür.«\n",
      "»Ah, das ist das Zimmer der Haushälterin.\n",
      "Dort sitzt die alte Frau Bernstone.\n",
      "Sie kann uns davon erzählen.\n",
      "Aber vielleicht würde es Ihnen nichts ausmachen, hier ein oder zwei Minuten zu warten.\n",
      "Denn sie ist nicht über unser Kommen informiert, und ist vielleicht beunruhigt, wenn wir alle zusammen hineingehen.\n",
      "Aber ruhig! was ist das?«\n",
      "Er hielt die Laterne hoch und bewegte sie in seiner Hand, bis die Lichtkreise flackerten und um uns herumtanzten.\n",
      "Miss Morstan packte mein Handgelenk und wir standen alle mit pochendem Herzen und gespitzten Ohren.\n",
      "Aus dem großen schwarzen Haus drang das schrille, traurige Winseln einer verängstigten Frau in die Stille der Nacht hinaus.\n",
      "»Es ist Mrs. Bernstone,« sagte Sholto. »Sie ist die einzige Frau im Haus.\n",
      "Warten Sie hier.\n",
      "Ich werde gleich zurück sein.« Er eilte zur Tür und klopfte auf seine eigentümliche Art. Wir konnten eine große alte Frau auf ihn zugehen sehen, die sich vergnügt wiegte, als sie ihn erkannte.\n",
      "»Oh, Mr. Thaddeus, Sir, ich bin so froh, daß Sie gekommen sind!\n",
      "Ich bin so froh, daß Sie gekommen sind, Mr. Thaddeus, Sir!« Wir hörten sie wiederholt jubeln, bis die Tür geschlossen wurde und ihre Stimme in einem gedämpften monotonen Klang erstarb.\n",
      "Unser Führer hatte uns die Laterne belassen.\n",
      "Holmes schwang sie langsam in die Runde und spähte scharf zum Haus und auf die großen Abfallhaufen, die im Hof lagen.\n",
      "Fräulein Morstan und ich standen zusammen, und ihre Hand war in meiner.\n",
      "Liebe ist eine wunderbare, feine Sache, denn hier standen wir zwei, die sich vor diesem Tag noch nie gesehen hatten, zwischen denen kein Wort oder kein Blick über die gegenseitige Zuneigung je ausgetauscht worden war, und doch suchten sich unsere Hände instinktiv in der Stunde der Schwierigkeiten.\n",
      "Ich habe mich später darüber gewundert, aber zu diesem Zeitpunkt schien es die natürlichste Sache der Welt zu sein, daß ich mich ihr näherte.\n",
      "Und wie sie mir später oft erzählte, wandte auch sie sich instinktiv auf der Suche nach Schutz und Beruhigung an mich.\n",
      "So standen wir Hand in Hand wie zwei Kinder und es herrschte Frieden in unseren Herzen trotz all der dunklen Sachen, die uns umgaben.\n",
      "»Was für ein seltsamer Ort!« sagte sie und sah sich um.\n",
      "»Es sieht so aus, als ob alle Maulwürfe Englands hier losgelassen worden wären.\n",
      "Ich habe etwas derartiges bei einem Hügel nahe Ballarat gesehen, wo die Schürfer bei der Arbeit gewesen waren.«\n",
      "»Und aus dem gleichen Grund,« sagte Holmes. »Dies sind die Spuren der Schatzsucher.\n",
      "Sie müssen daran denken, daß sie sechs Jahre gesucht haben.\n",
      "Kein Wunder, daß das Grundstück wie eine Kiesgrube aussieht.«\n",
      "In diesem Moment sprang die Tür des Hauses auf und Thaddeus Sholto kam vorgestreckten Händen heraus gerannt, in seinen Augen stand der blanke Schrecken.\n",
      "»Es ist etwas Schreckliches mit Bartholomew passiert!«, rief er. »Ich habe Angst!\n",
      "Meine Nerven halten das nicht aus!« Er zitterte wirklich vor Angst und sein zuckendes schwaches Gesicht hatte den Ausdruck eines hilflosen Kindes, wie es aus dem großen Astrakhankragen herauslugte.\n",
      "»Kommen Sie ins Haus«, sagte Holmes auf seine trockene, bestimmende Art.\n",
      "»Ja bitte,« bat Thaddeus Sholto. »Ich bin wirklich nicht in der Lage, Anweisungen zu geben.«\n",
      "Wir alle folgte ihm ins Zimmer der Haushälterin, das sich auf der linken Seite des Flures befand.\n",
      "Die alte Frau ging auf und ab und hatte einen ängstlichen Blick und unruhig zuckende Finger.\n",
      "Aber der Anblick von Fräulein Morstan schien eine besänftigende Wirkung auf sie auszuüben.\n",
      "»Gott segne Ihr liebes, ruhiges Gesicht!« rief sie mit einem hysterischen Schluchzer. »Es tut mir gut, Sie zu sehen.\n",
      "Ach, aber ich bin heute stark geprüft worden!«\n",
      "Unser Begleiter tätschelte ihre dünne, abgearbeitete Hand, und murmelte einige Worte von weiblicher Bequemlichkeit, die sofort Farbe in die blutleeren Wangen der Frau zurückbrachten.\n",
      "»Der Herr hat sich eingesperrt und antwortet mir nicht,« erklärte sie. »Den ganzen Tag habe ich auf ein Zeichen von ihm gewartet.\n",
      "Denn oft liebt er das Alleinsein.\n",
      "Doch vor einer Stunde fürchtete ich, daß irgend etwas nicht stimmte.\n",
      "So ging ich hinaus und schaute durch das Schlüsselloch.\n",
      "Mr. Thaddeus, sie müssen hinauf – sie müssen hinauf und selbst schauen.\n",
      "Ich habe Herrn Bartholomew mehr als zehn Jahre lang in Freude und in Kummer gesehen, aber ich sah ihn noch niemals mit einem derartigen Gesicht.«\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes nahm die Lampe und zeigte uns den Weg, denn Thaddeus Sholto's Zähne klapperten.\n",
      "Er war so am Zittern, daß ich meine Hand unter seinen Arm legen mußte als wir die Treppen hinaufstiegen, auch seine Knie zitterten.\n",
      "Während wir hinaufstiegen, holte Holmes zweimal seine Lupe aus der Tasche und inspizierte einige Stellen, die mir wie bloße formlose Flecken von Staub auf der kakaobraunen Matte erschienen, die als Teppich auf den Stufen lag.\n",
      "Er ging langsam, Schritt für Schritt, hielt dabei die Lampe und schoß scharfe Blicke nach links und rechts.\n",
      "Miss Morstan war mit der ängstlichen Haushälterin zurückgeblieben.\n",
      "Die dritte Treppenflucht endete in einem geraden, langen Korridor mit einem großen indischen Bild zur Rechten und drei Türen auf der linken Seite.\n",
      "Holmes bewegte sich in der gleichen langsamen und methodischen Art vorwärts und wir hefteten uns an seine Fersen, wobei unsere langen Schatten in den Korridor zurückgeworfen wurden.\n",
      "Es war die dritte Tür, die wir suchten.\n",
      "Holmes klopfte, ohne eine Antwort zu erhalten, und versuchte dann, den Griff mit Gewalt zu drehen, um die Tür zu öffnen.\n",
      "Sie war jedoch von innen durch einen großen, schweren Bolzen verschlossen, wie wir sahen, als wir unsere Lampe dagegen hielten.\n",
      "Obwohl der Schlüssel umgedreht war, war das Loch nicht vollständig verschlossen.\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes bückte sich hinunter, und richtete sich sofort mit einem starken Atemzug wieder auf.\n",
      "»Hier ist etwas teuflisches drin, Watson,« sagte er, bewegter als ich ihn jemals gesehen hatte. »Was halten Sie davon?«\n",
      "Ich beugte mich zum Schlüsselloch und stieß in Horror zurück.\n",
      "Das Mondlicht strömte ins Zimmer und es war mit einer spärlichen Helligkeit erfüllt.\n",
      "Mich sah ein Gesicht direkt an, es hing frei in der Luft, denn darunter war nur Schatten.\n",
      "Es war das gleiche Gesicht wie das unseres Begleiters Thaddeus.\n",
      "Der gleiche hohe Kopf mit dem glänzenden Schädel, der gleiche ringförmige Kranz aus roten Haarbüscheln, der gleiche blutleere Gesichtsausdruck.\n",
      "Alles war gleich, bis auf das schreckliche, unnatürliche Grinsen, das im stillen und mondbeschienenen Zimmer mehr berührte als ein finsterer Blick oder eine Grimasse.\n",
      "So sehr ähnelte das Gesicht unserem kleinen Freund, daß ich mich umsah um sicher zu sein, daß er tatsächlich bei uns war.\n",
      "Dann brachte ich mir in Erinnerung, daß er uns gegenüber erwähnt hatte, daß sein Bruder und er Zwillinge waren.\n",
      "»Das ist schrecklich!« sagte ich zu Holmes, »Was wollen wir tun?«\n",
      "»Die Tür muß geöffnet werden«, antwortete er und sprang dagegen.\n",
      "Er setzte all sein Gewicht gegen das Schloß.\n",
      "Es knarrte und stöhnte, aber gab nicht nach.\n",
      "Gemeinsam schleuderten wir uns noch einmal dagegen und diesmal gab sie mit einem abrupten Schnapplaut nach.\n",
      "Wir befanden uns in Bartholonew Sholto's Zimmer.\n",
      "Es war wie ein chemisches Laboratorium eingerichtet.\n",
      "Eine doppelte Reihe von Flaschen mit Glasstöpseln befand sich an der Wand gegenüber der Tür und der Tisch war mit Bunsenbrennern, Schläuchen und Retorten übersät.\n",
      "In den Ecken standen Glasballons mit Säure in Weidenkörben.\n",
      "Einer von ihnen schien undicht oder zerbrochen zu sein, ein Strom dunkelfarbiger Flüssigkeit war herausgerieselt und die Luft war von einem stechenden, teerähnlichen Geruch geschwängert.\n",
      "Eine Trittleiter stand an der einen Seite des Zimmers inmitten von Abfall aus Gips und Holzlatten.\n",
      "Darüber befand sich ein Loch in der Decke, groß genug für einen Menschen zum Hindurchkriechen.\n",
      "Am Fuß der Leiter lag eine Seilrolle nachlässig zusammengelegt herum.\n",
      "Dicht beim Tisch saß der Herr des Hauses in einem hölzernen Lehnstuhl.\n",
      "Sein Kopf war auf die linke Schulter gesunken und er hatte immer noch dieses gräßliche, unergründliche Lächeln auf seinem Gesicht.\n",
      "Er war steif und kalt und eindeutig schon mehrere Stunden tot.\n",
      "Mir schien, daß nicht nur sein Gesichtsausdruck, sondern alle Glieder gedreht und und in einer sehr seltsamen Art arrangiert worden wären.\n",
      "Neben seiner Hand lag ein besonderes Instrument auf dem Tisch – ein brauner, eng gemaserter Stock mit einem steinernen Kopf ähnlich einem Hammer und mit grobem Bindfaden angebunden.\n",
      "Daneben lag ein zerrissener Notizzettel mit einigen Worten darauf hingekritzelt.\n",
      "Holm blickte darauf und gab es mir dann.\n",
      "»Sehen Sie,« sagte er mit einem bedeutungsvollen Heben der Augenbrauen.\n",
      "Im Licht der Laterne las ich mit einem leichten Gruseln »Das Zeichen der Vier«\n",
      "»In Gottes Namen, was bedeutet dies alles?« fragte ich.\n",
      "»Es bedeutet Mord,« sagte er und beugte sich über den toten Mann. »Ah, ich habe es erwartet.\n",
      "Sehen Sie hier!« Er zeigte auf etwas, das wie ein langer, dunkler Dorn aussah und in der Haut über dem Ohr steckte.\n",
      "»Es sieht wie ein Dorn aus,« sagte ich.\n",
      "»Es ist ein Dorn.\n",
      "Sie können ihn herausnehmen.\n",
      "Aber seien Sie vorsichtig, er ist vergiftet.«\n",
      "Ich nahm ihn zwischen Daumen und Zeigefinger.\n",
      "Er ließ sich so leicht aus der Haut herausziehen, daß kaum ein Anzeichen zurückblieb.\n",
      "Ein winziger Blutfleck zeigte, wo das Loch gewesen war.\n",
      "»Dies ist für mich ein unlösbares Rätsel«, sagte ich. »Es wird immer undurchsichtiger statt klarer.«\n",
      "»Ganz im Gegenteil,« antwortete er, »es klärt sich jeden Moment auf.\n",
      "Ich benötige nur noch ein paar fehlende Verbindungen um einen völlig gelösten Fall zu bekommen.«\n",
      "Seit wir den Raum betreten hatten, hatten wir fast die Gegenwart unseres Begleiters vergessen.\n",
      "Er stand immer noch im Türrahmen und war schrecklich anzusehen.\n",
      "Er wrang seine Hände und stöhnte in sich hinein.\n",
      "Plötzlich brach er in einen scharfen, mürrischen Schrei aus.\n",
      "»Der Schatz ist fort!« sagte er, »Sie haben ihm den Schatz gestohlen.\n",
      "Dort ist das Loch, wo er ihn hinabgelassen hat.\n",
      "Ich half ihm, es zu tun!\n",
      "Ich war der letzte, der ihn gesehen hat!\n",
      "Ich habe ihn hier letzte Nacht allein gelassen und ich hörte, wie er die Tür verschloß, als ich die Treppe hinabstieg.«\n",
      "»Um welche Uhrzeit war das?«\n",
      "»Es war zehn Uhr.\n",
      "Und nun ist er tot und die Polizei wird verständigt werden.\n",
      "Und sie werden mich verdächtigten, Hand an ihn gelegt zu haben.\n",
      "Oh ja, man wird mich verdächtigen.\n",
      "Aber Sie glauben es doch nicht, Gentlemen?\n",
      "Sicher glauben Sie nicht, daß ich es war?\n",
      "Falls ich es war, hätte ich Sie vermutlich nicht hierher gebracht.\n",
      "O Gott!\n",
      "O Gott!\n",
      "Ich glaube, ich werde verrückt!« Er ruckte mit seinen Armen und stampfte mit den Füßen in krampfhaft wilder Erregung.\n",
      "»Sie haben keinen Grund Angst zu haben, Mr. Sholto,« sagte Holmes freundlich und legte ihn seine Hand auf die Schulter. »Nehmen Sie meinen Rat und fahren Sie zum Bahnhof und berichten Sie diesen Vorfall.\n",
      "Bieten Sie jede Art von Hilfe an.\n",
      "Wir warten hier auf Ihre Rückkehr.«\n",
      "Der kleine Mann gehorchte mit verblüfftem Gesicht und wir hörten ihn die Stufen in die Dunkelheit hinaus stolpern.\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes' Demonstration\n",
      "»Jetzt, Watson,« sagte Holmes und rieb seine Hände, »haben wir noch eine halbe Stunde für uns.\n",
      "Wir wollen sie gut nutzen.\n",
      "Wie ich schon sagte, ist mein Fall fast vollständig gelöst, aber wir dürfen uns nicht irren, wenn wir so zuversichtlich sind.\n",
      "So einfach wie der Fall jetzt scheint, kann ihm noch etwas tieferes zugrunde liegen«.\n",
      "»Natürlich!« stieß ich hervor.\n",
      "»Bestimmt,« sagte er mit der Stimme eines Universitätsprofessors, der seine Studenten belehrt. »Setzen Sie sich dort in die Ecke, damit ihre Fußabdrücke die Sache nicht noch komplizieren.\n",
      "Nun zur Arbeit!\n",
      "Zuallererst, wie kamen die Leute herein und wie sind sie verschwunden?\n",
      "Die Tür wurde seit gestern Nacht nicht geöffnet.\n",
      "Wie sieht es mit dem Fenster aus?« Er brachte die Laterne dort hin und murmelte seine Beobachtungen vor sich hin; er sprach dabei aber mehr mit sich selbst als zu mir. »Das Fenster ist an der Innenseite eingehakt.\n",
      "Der Rahmen ist solide.\n",
      "Keine Scharniere an der Seite.\n",
      "Öffnen wir es!\n",
      "Kein Regenrohr in der Nähe.\n",
      "Das Dach ist unerreichbar.\n",
      "Und doch ist jemand über das Fenster gekommen.\n",
      "Es hat letzte Nacht ein wenig geregnet.\n",
      "Hier ist ein Fußabdruck im Schimmel der Fensterbank.\n",
      "Und hier ist auch ein runder Schmutzfleck, und hier auf dem Fußboden ebenfalls, und auch hier neben dem Tisch.\n",
      "Sehen Sie Watson.\n",
      "Das ist eine schöne Demonstration.«\n",
      "Ich sah mir die kreisrunden Schmutzflecken an.\n",
      "»Das ist kein Fußabdruck,« sagte ich.\n",
      "»Für uns ist es etwas viel wertvolleres.\n",
      "Es ist der Abdruck eines hölzernen Stumpfes.\n",
      "Sehen Sie hier auf der Fensterbank, da ist ein Stiefelabdruck von einem schweren Stiefel mit einer breiten Metallferse; und daneben ist der Fleck des Stockabdrucks.«\n",
      "»Es ist der Mann mit dem Holzbein.«\n",
      "»Genauso ist es.\n",
      "Aber da war noch jemand, ein sehr fähiger und tüchtiger Verbündeter.\n",
      "Könnte man die Mauer erklimmen, Doktor?«\n",
      "»Vollkommen unmöglich«, antwortete ich.\n",
      "»Ohne Hilfe sicherlich.\n",
      "Aber nehmen wir einmal an, daß Sie einen Freund hätten, der dieses starke Seil dort in der Ecke herabließ und das eine Ende an diesem großen Haken in der Mauer sicherte.\n",
      "Wenn Sie ein agiler Mann wären, dann glaube ich, daß Sie trotz Holzbein hinaufkommen könnten.\n",
      "Hinunter würden Sie natürlich auf die gleiche Art gelangen.\n",
      "Und Ihr Gehilfe würde das Seil heraufziehen, es vom Haken lösen, daß Fenster schließen und wieder von innen einhaken und dann den Ort genauso verlassen wie er vorher gekommen war.\n",
      "Einen kleinen Punkt muß ich noch anmerken,« fuhr er fort und spielte mit dem Seil, »unser holzbeiniger Freund ist zwar ein guter Bergsteiger, aber kein richtiger Seemann.\n",
      "Seine Hände hatten zuwenig Schwielen.\n",
      "Meine Lupe zeigt mir mehr als einen Blutfleck, besonders am Ende des Seils.\n",
      "Daraus folgere ich, das er so schnell herunterrutschte, daß sich die Haut von seinen Händen löste.«\n",
      "»Das ist alles schön und gut,« sagte ich, »aber die Sache wird dadurch unverständlicher wie je zuvor.\n",
      "Was ist mit diesem mysteriösen Verbündeten?\n",
      "Wie kam er ins Zimmer?«\n",
      "»Ja, der Verbündete!« wiederholte Holmes nachdenklich. »Es gibt interessante Merkmale über diesen Verbündeten.\n",
      "Er macht aus einem gewöhnlichen Kriminalfall einen ungewöhnlichen.\n",
      "Ich denke, damit wird ein neues Kapitel in der Verbrechensgeschichte dieses Landes geschrieben – obwohl man ähnliche Fälle aus Indien, und wenn ich mich nicht irre, auch aus Senegambia kennt.«\n",
      "»Wie aber kam er hinein,« wiederholte ich. »Die Tür war verschlossen und das Fenster unzugänglich.\n",
      "Kam er durch den Schornstein?«\n",
      "»Der Kamin ist viel zu klein,« antwortete er. »Ich hatte diese Möglichkeit auch schon in Betracht gezogen.«\n",
      "»Wie dann?« beharrte ich.\n",
      "»Sie wollen meine Lehre nicht annehmen,« sagte er und schüttelte den Kopf. »Wie oft habe ich Ihnen gesagt, daß wenn man das Unmögliche ausschließt, ist das Verbleibende die Wahrheit, egal wie unwahrscheinlich es ist.\n",
      "Wir wissen, daß er nicht durch die Tür, das Fenster oder den Schornstein kam.\n",
      "Wir wissen auch, daß er nicht im Zimmer verborgen war, da dort kein Verstecken möglich war.\n",
      "Woher kam er dann also?«\n",
      "»Er kam durch das Loch in der Decke,« rief ich.\n",
      "»Natürlich muß er es so gemacht haben.\n",
      "Wenn Sie bitte die Lampe für mich halten würden.\n",
      "Wir werden jetzt unsere Untersuchungen im oberen Zimmer fortsetzen – im geheimen Zimmer, in dem der Schatz gefunden wurde.«\n",
      "Er bestieg die Trittleiter, packte den Dachsparren mit einer Hand und schwang sich in die Dachstube hinauf.\n",
      "Er legte sich flach hin, langte nach der Lampe und hielt sie, während ich ihm nachfolgte.\n",
      "Die Kammer, in der wir uns befanden, maß etwa zehn Fuß in der einen und sechs Fuß in der anderen Richtung.\n",
      "Den Boden bildeten die Dachsparren, mit einem dünnen Stroh- und Gipsgemisch dazwischen.\n",
      "Um darauf zu gehen, mußte man von einem Balken auf den anderen treten.\n",
      "Die Wände liefen schräg zu und waren anscheinend vom richtigen Dach durch einen Zwischenraum getrennt.\n",
      "Es gab keinerlei Möbel, und der Staub vieler Jahre lag auf dem Boden.\n",
      "»Hier sind wir nun,« sagte Sherlock Holmes und legte die Hand an die schräge Wand. »Hier ist eine Falltür, die auf das Dach hinausführt.\n",
      "Ich kann sie aufdrücken und dort erst ist die Dachschräge.\n",
      "Dies ist der Weg, über den Nummer Eins gekommen ist.\n",
      "Wir wollen sehen, ob wir andere Spuren seiner Identität finden.«\n",
      "Er führte die Lampe zum Boden und ich bemerkte dabei heute schon zum zweitenmal, daß ein erschrockener, überraschter Ausdruck sein Gesicht überzog.\n",
      "Als ich seinem Blick folgte, schauerte es mich unter meiner Kleidung.\n",
      "Der Fußboden war mit Abdrücken eines nackten Fußes übersät – deutlich und wohlgeformt, aber knapp halb so groß wie der Abdruck eines normalen Menschen.\n",
      "»Holmes,« flüsterte ich, »ein Kind hat diese Greueltat begangen.«\n",
      "Er hatte seine Selbstbeherrschung augenblicklich wiedergefunden.\n",
      "»Ich war einen Moment unsicher,« sagte er, »aber die Sache ist ganz einfach.\n",
      "Wenn mich mein Gedächtnis nicht für einen Moment verlassen hätte, hätte ich es vorausgesagt.\n",
      "Hier können wir nichts mehr in Erfahrung bringen.\n",
      "Gehen wir wieder hinab.«\n",
      "»Welche Theorie haben sie denn nun über die Fußabdrücke?« fragte ich neugierig, als wir in das untere Zimmer zurückkamen.\n",
      "»Lieber Dr. Watson, versuchen Sie diese kleine Analyse selbst,« sagte er in ungeduldigem Ton. »Sie kennen meine Methoden.\n",
      "Wenden Sie sie an, dann ist es lehrreich, die Ergebnisse zu vergleichen.«\n",
      "»Mir fällt nichts ein, das alle Tatsachen umfaßt,« antwortete ich.\n",
      "»Es wird Ihnen schnell klar werden,« sagte er lässig. »Hier gibt es sonst nichts Wichtiges mehr, aber wir wollen einmal sehen.« Er zog seine Lupe und ein Zentimetermaß heraus und krabbelte auf Knien im Raum herum, dabei alles messend, vergleichend und untersuchend.\n",
      "Seine große Nase war nur wenige Zoll von den Bodenbrettern entfernt und seine tiefen, wachen Augen glänzten wie die eines Vogels.\n",
      "Seine flinken, geräuschlosen und geheimnisvollen Bewegungen ähnelten einem Bluthund, der eine Fährte aufgenommen hatte.\n",
      "Ich kam nicht umhin daran zu denken, welch schrecklicher und gefährlicher Verbrecher er mit seiner Energie und seinem Scharfsinn hätte werden können, wenn er nicht für, sondern gegen das Gesetz arbeiten würde.\n",
      "Beim Herumschnüffeln murmelte er weiter vor sich hin und brach plötzlich in ein schallendes Gelächter aus.\n",
      "»Wir haben wirklich Glück,« sagte er. »Wir sollten jetzt kaum noch Probleme haben.\n",
      "Nummer Eins hatte das Pech, in Kreosot zu treten.\n",
      "Hier sieht man den Umriß seinen kleines Fußes am Rand dieser übelriechende Masse.\n",
      "Der Glasbehälter ist gesprungen und das Zeug ist hier herausgelaufen.«\n",
      "»Und nun?«, fragte ich.\n",
      "»Nun haben wir ihn, das ist alles,« sagte er. »Ich kenne einen Hund, der diesem Geruch bis an das Ende der Welt folgen würde.\n",
      "Wenn eine Meute einem über den Boden einer Grafschaft geschleiften Hering nachspüren kann, wie weit kann dann ein speziell geschulter Hund einem derart stechenden Geruch folgen?\n",
      "So sicher wie Eins und Eins Zwei ergibt.\n",
      "Die Antwort wird uns – aber hallo!\n",
      "Hier sind die Hüter des Gesetzes.«\n",
      "Schwere Schritte und lauter Stimmenlärm waren unten zu hören.\n",
      "Die Korridortür schlug mit einem lauten Krach zu.\n",
      "»Bevor sie hier sind,« sagte Holmes, »legen Sie Ihre Hand genau hier auf den Arm dieses armen Kerls, und auch hier auf sein Bein.\n",
      "Was fühlen Sie?«\n",
      "»Die Muskeln sind hart wie ein Brett,« antwortete ich.\n",
      "»So ist es.\n",
      "Sie haben sich extrem zusammengezogen, viel stärker als beim normalen ›rigor mortis‹.\n",
      "Nimmt man die Gesichtsverzerrungen hinzu, dieses hippokratische Lächeln, auch ›risus sardonicus‹ in den alten Schriften genannt, welche Schlußfolgerung würden Sie ziehen?«\n",
      "»Tod durch ein stark wirkendes pflanzliches Alkaloid,« antwortete ich, »eine dem Strychnin ähnliche Substanz, die die Starre erzeugen könnte.«\n",
      "»Genau diese Idee kam mir in dem Moment, als ich die angespannten Muskel im Gesicht sah.\n",
      "Als ich ins Zimmer kam, habe ich sofort nach der Methode gesucht, mit der man das Gift in den Körper bringen könnte.\n",
      "Wie sie wissen, entdeckte ich einen Dorn, der mit wenig Kraft in die Kopfhaut gedrückt oder geschossen wurde.\n",
      "Und Sie haben sicher bemerkt, daß die getroffene Stelle genau zum Loch in der Decke zeigte, als der Mann noch aufrecht in seinem Stuhl saß.\n",
      "Und nun sehen Sie sich den Dorn an.«\n",
      "Ich nahm ihn vorsichtig auf und hielt ihn in das Licht der Laterne.\n",
      "Er war lang, scharf und schwarz, mit einem glasigen Aussehen in der Nähe der Spitze, als ob irgendeine gummiartige Substanz auf ihm angetrocknet war.\n",
      "Das stumpfe Ende war bearbeitet und mit einem Messer abgerundet worden.\n",
      "»Ist dies ein Dorn, den man in England findet?« fragte er.\n",
      "»Nein, gewiß nicht.«\n",
      "»Mit all diesen Fakten sollten Sie in der Lage sein, Ihre Schlußfolgerungen zu ziehen.\n",
      "Doch hier kommen die Berufssoldaten, und die Hilfstruppen sollten sich zurückziehen.«\n",
      "Während seiner Rede wurden die Schritte der Herankommenden im Gang lauter und ein sehr korpulenter, untersetzter Mann in einem grauen Anzug schritt ins Zimmer.\n",
      "Er hatte ein rötliches, dickes Gesicht und sehr kleine, blitzende Augen, die scharf aus den geschwollenen und aufgedunsenen Wangen stachen.\n",
      "Dicht hinter ihm trat ein uniformierter Inspektor ein, gefolgt vom immer noch heftig zuckenden Thaddeus Sholto.\n",
      "»Hier gibt's Arbeit,« rief er mit einer dumpfen, heiseren Stimme. »Hier gibt's gewaltig Arbeit!\n",
      "Und wer sind die hier?\n",
      "Dies Haus scheint ein Karnickelstall zu sein!«\n",
      "»Sicherlich können Sie sich an mich erinnern, Mr. Athelney Jones,« sagte Holmes ruhig.\n",
      "»Natürlich kann ich das,« sagte er mit zischendem Tonfall. »Sie sind Sherlock Holmes, der Theoretiker.\n",
      "Denken Sie, ich habe Ihre Vorlesung über all die Schlußfolgerungen und Ursachen und Wirkungen im Bishop Juwelenraubfall vergessen?\n",
      "Sie haben uns wohl auf die richtige Spur gesetzt, aber Sie müssen zugeben, daß es mehr Glück als Verstand war.«\n",
      "»Es war nur einfaches logisches Denken.«\n",
      "»Ach, kommen Sie!\n",
      "Jetzt, kommen Sie!\n",
      "Schämen Sie sich nicht, es zuzugeben.\n",
      "Aber was ist hier los?\n",
      "Böse Sache!\n",
      "Sehr böse Sache!\n",
      "Eindeutige Tatsachen – kein Platz für Theorien.\n",
      "Welch ein Glück, daß ich gerade wegen eines anderen Falls in Norwood war!\n",
      "Ich war am Bahnhof als ich die Nachricht erhielt.\n",
      "Was glauben Sie, woran der Mann starb?«\n",
      "»Oh, hierüber kann ich wohl nicht theoretisieren,« sagte Holmes trocken.\n",
      "»Nein.\n",
      "Aber wir können nicht leugnen, daß Sie manchmal den Nagel auf den Kopf treffen.\n",
      "Aha, die Tür war verschlossen, wie ich sehe.\n",
      "Es fehlen Juwelen für ein halbe Million.\n",
      "Was war mit dem Fenster?«\n",
      "»Geschlossen, aber es gibt Fußspuren auf dem Fensterbrett.«\n",
      "»Gut, gut, wenn es gesichert war, können die Abdrücke nichts mit dem Fall zu tun haben.\n",
      "Das sagt mir der gesunde Menschenverstand.\n",
      "Der Mann könnte an einem Anfall gestorben sein, aber es fehlen ja die Juwelen.\n",
      "Ha!\n",
      "Ich habe eine Theorie.\n",
      "Manchmal überkommen mich solche Gedankenblitze.\n",
      "– Sergeant, und Sie Mr. Sholto, gehen Sie bitte hinaus.\n",
      "Die anderen können bleiben.\n",
      "– Was denken Sie, Mr. Holmes?\n",
      "Sholto war nach eigener Aussage gestern bei seinem Bruder.\n",
      "Der Bruder hatte einen Schlaganfall, daraufhin verschwand Sholto mit dem Schatz.\n",
      "Wie gefällt Ihnen das?«\n",
      "»Woraufhin der Tote voller Rücksichtnahme aufstand und die Tür von innen verschloß.«\n",
      "»Hm!\n",
      "Da stimmt was nicht.\n",
      "Versuchen wir es mit gesundem Menschenverstand.\n",
      "Dieser Thaddeus Sholto war bei seinem Bruder; es war ein Streit zwischen ihnen; soviel wissen wir.\n",
      "Der Bruder ist tot und die Edelsteine sind fort.\n",
      "Soviel wissen wir ebenfalls.\n",
      "Niemand sah den Bruder, nachdem Thaddeus fortgegangen war.\n",
      "Er schlief nicht in seinem Bett.\n",
      "Augenscheinlich ist Thaddeus sehr verstört.\n",
      "Er sieht – naja, er sieht nicht gerade ansprechend aus.\n",
      "Sie sehen, wie ich mein Netz um Thaddeus herumwebe.\n",
      "Das Netz zieht sich über ihm zusammen.«\n",
      "»Sie kennen noch nicht alle Tatsachen,« sagte Holmes. »Dieser Holzsplitter, von dem ich annehme, daß er vergiftet ist, steckte in der Kopfhaut des Mannes.\n",
      "Sie können immer noch die Stelle erkennen.\n",
      "Und dieses beschriftete Papier lag auf dem Tisch, daneben lag dieses seltsame Instrument mit dem steinernen Kopf.\n",
      "Wie paßt das alles zu Ihrer Theorie?«\n",
      "»Bestätigt mich in allen Dingen,« sagte der fette Detektiv wichtigtuerisch. »Das Haus ist voll von indischen Kuriositäten.\n",
      "So sagte Thaddeus.\n",
      "Und falls der Splitter giftig war, wurde er wohl eher von Thaddeus als von einem anderen Mann benutzt.\n",
      "Das Papier ist irgendein Hokuspokus – zur Tarnung.\n",
      "Die Frage ist nur, wie kam er heraus?\n",
      "Oh, hier ist ja ein Loch in der Decke.« Mit einer für seine Größe erstaunlichen Geschwindigkeit stieg er auf die Stufen und quetsche sich in die Dachstube.\n",
      "Kurz danach hörte man ihn fröhlich rufen, daß er die Falltür gefunden hatte.\n",
      "»Lassen wir ihn finden,« bemerkte Holmes mit einem Schulterzucken. »Gelegentlich hat er vernünftige Einfälle.\n",
      "Il n'y a pas des sots si incommodes que ceux qui ont de l'esprit!\n",
      "»\n",
      "»Sehen Sie,« sagte Athelny Jones und erschien wieder auf den Stufen. »Tatsachen sind immer besser als bloße Theorien.\n",
      "Meine Sicht des Falls ist bestätigt.\n",
      "Es gibt eine Falltür, die zum Dach führt, und sie steht halb offen.«\n",
      "»Ich habe sie geöffnet.«\n",
      "»Oh, haben Sie sie auch bemerkt?« Mit dieser Entdeckung wirkte er ein wenig geknickt. »Egal, wer sie fand, hierüber ist unser Gentleman entkommen.\n",
      "Inspektor!«\n",
      "»Ja, Sir,« kam es aus dem Gang.\n",
      "»Bitten Sie Mr. Sholto, hierher zu kommen.\n",
      "– Mr. Sholto, es ist meine Pflicht, Sie darauf aufmerksam zu machen, daß alles was Sie jetzt sagen gegen Sie verwendet werden kann.\n",
      "Ich verhafte Sie im Namen der Königin, den Tod Ihres Bruders betreffend.«\n",
      "»Sehen Sie, habe ich es nicht gesagt,« rief der arme kleine Mann, die Hände vorstreckend und von einem zum andern blickend.\n",
      "»Sorgen Sie sich darüber nicht, Mr. Sholto,« sagte Holmes. »Ich glaube daß ich Sie von dieser Beschuldigung befreien kann.«\n",
      "»Versprechen Sie nicht zuviel, Mr. Theoretiker – versprechen Sie nicht zuviel!« schnappte der Detektiv zurück. »Es könnte Ihnen schwerer fallen, als Sie annehmen.«\n",
      "»Ich werde die Anklage nicht nur forträumen, Mr. Jones.\n",
      "Ich werde Ihnen außerdem als Geschenk den Namen und die Beschreibung einer der beiden Personen geben, die letzte Nacht im Zimmer waren.\n",
      "Ich habe viele Gründe anzunehmen, daß sein Name Jonathan Small ist.\n",
      "Er ist ein ungebildeter Mann, klein, lebhaft, das rechte Bein fehlt und er hat einen Holzfuß, der an der Innenseite aufgescheuert ist.\n",
      "Sein linker Stiefel hat eine grobe, kreuzgeriffelte Sohle mit einem Eisenband am Absatz.\n",
      "Er ist mittleren Alters, stark sonnengebräunt und war ein Sträfling.\n",
      "Diese wenigen Hinweise könnten ihnen helfen.\n",
      "Hinzu kommt die Tatsache, daß ein Großteil seiner Haut an der Handinnenfläche fehlt.\n",
      "Der andere Mann –«\n",
      "»Was, der andere Mann –?« fragte Athelny Jones mit schnarrender Stimme.\n",
      "Er war von Holmes präziser Art der Beschreibung beeindruckt.\n",
      "»Ist eine sehr seltsame Person,« sagte Sherlock Holmes und drehte sich auf dem Absatz um. »Ich hoffe Ihnen das Paar bald vorstellen zu können.\n",
      "– Auf ein Wort, Watson.«\n",
      "Er führte mich zum Treppenabsatz.\n",
      "»Durch diesen unerwarteten Auftritt haben wir leider das Ziel unserer Reise aus den Augen verloren.«\n",
      "»Ich habe ebenfalls daran gedacht,« antwortete ich. »Miss Morstan sollte nicht in diesem leidgetroffenen Haus bleiben.«\n",
      "»Nein, Sie müssen Sie nach Hause begleiten.\n",
      "Sie wohnt bei Mrs. Cecil Forrester in Lower Camberwell: das ist nicht weit von hier.\n",
      "Ich warte hier auf Sie, bis Sie zurück sind.\n",
      "Oder sind Sie etwa zu müde?«\n",
      "»Auf keinen Fall.\n",
      "Ich kann mich nicht ausruhen, bis ich mehr über dieses phantastische Ereignis erfahren habe.\n",
      "Ich habe schon einige schreckliche Dinge in meinem Leben erlebt, aber die heutige Abfolge von seltsamen Ereignissen hat meine Nerven ganz schön zerrüttet.\n",
      "Nachdem ich nun schon soweit gekommen bin, möchte ich die Sache mit Ihnen gemeinsam durchstehen.\n",
      "»Ihre Mitarbeit ist mir sehr dienlich,« antwortete er. »Wir sollten den Fall unabhängig voneinander bearbeiten.\n",
      "Dieser Jones kann weiter an seinen Märchengeschichten arbeiten.\n",
      "Wenn Sie Miss Morstan abgesetzt haben, möchte ich, daß sie zur Pinchin Lane Nummer 3 gehen, das ist dicht am Wasser in Lambeth.\n",
      "Das dritte Haus auf der rechten Seite gehört einem Vogelpräparator: er heißt Sherman.\n",
      "Im Fenster hängt ein Wiesel, das ein junges Kaninchen gefaßt hat.\n",
      "Wecken Sie den alten Sherman auf und sagen Sie ihm, mit meinen Empfehlungen, daß ich Toby sofort brauche.\n",
      "Sie bringen Toby dann in der Droschke mit.«\n",
      "»Ein Hund, nehme ich an.«\n",
      "»Ja, – eine eigenartige Promenadenmischung mit einer höchst erstaunlichen Fähigkeit im Fährtenlesen.\n",
      "Ich möchte lieber Toby's Hilfe, als die der gesamten Londoner Detektivtruppe.«\n",
      "»Nun, dann bringe ich ihn,« sagte ich. »Jetzt ist es ein Uhr.\n",
      "Ich werde vor drei Uhr zurück sein, falls ich ein frisches Pferd finde.«\n",
      "»Und ich will sehen,« sagte Holmes, »was ich von Mrs. Bernstone erfahren kann, und auch vom indischen Diener.\n",
      "Mr. Thaddeus sagte, er schliefe in der benachbarten Dachkammer.\n",
      "Dann werde ich die Methoden des großen Jones studieren und seinen nicht sehr delikaten Sarkasmen lauschen.\n",
      "›Wir sind gewohnt, daß die Menschen verhöhnen was sie nicht verstehen.\n",
      "‹ Goethe ist immer inhaltsvoll.«\n",
      "Die Episode mit dem Faß\n",
      "Die Polizisten waren in einer Droschke gekommen.\n",
      "In dieser brachte ich Miss Morstan nach Hause.\n",
      "Mit der engelhaften Geduld der Frauen hatte sie die Aufregung mit gleichmütigem Gesicht ertragen, solange es jemand anderen gab, der umsorgt werden mußte.\n",
      "Ich fand sie wach und gelassen an der Seite der aufgeregten Haushälterin.\n",
      "In der Droschke jedoch war sie einer Ohnmacht nahe und fing hemmungslos zu weinen an – so sehr war sie von den Abenteuern dieses Tages mitgenommen.\n",
      "Später erzählte sie mir, daß sie mich während der Fahrt als kalt und distanziert empfand.\n",
      "Sie konnte den Kampf in meinem Innersten nicht im geringsten erahnen, auch nicht das Bemühen um Selbstbeherrschung, das mich hemmte.\n",
      "Meine Sympathien und meine Liebe galten ihr, genau wie meine Hand vorher im Garten.\n",
      "Ich fühlte, daß auch Jahre des gemeinsamen Lebens mir ihre süße, tapfere Natur nicht näherbringen konnten, als dieser ereignisreichen Tag.\n",
      "Aber es gab zwei Überlegungen, die meine Lippen für zärtliche Worte versiegelten.\n",
      "Sie war schwach und hilflos, die Gedanken und Nerven in Aufruhr.\n",
      "Ihr meine Liebe zu so einem unpassenden Zeitpunkt aufzudrängen, hätte nachteilige Folgen gehabt.\n",
      "Und was noch schlimmer war, sie war reich.\n",
      "Wenn Holmes' Nachforschungen erfolgreich wären, würde sie eine reiche Erbin sein.\n",
      "Wäre es richtig und ehrenhaft, wenn ein Chirurg mit einer halben Stelle diesen Vorteil der Intimität ausgenutzt hätte, die sich zufällig ergeben hatte?\n",
      "Würde sie mich nicht als einen gewöhnlichen Glückssucher betrachten?\n",
      "Ich konnte es nicht riskieren, daß ihr solche Gedanken in den Sinn kamen.\n",
      "Der Agra-Schatz war wie ein unüberwindbares Hindernis zwischen uns aufgebaut.\n",
      "Es war beinahe zwei Uhr, als wir das Haus von Mrs. Cecil Forrester erreichten.\n",
      "Die Bediensteten waren schon vor Stunden zu Bett gegangen.\n",
      "Mrs. Forrester jedoch war über die seltsame an Miss Morstan ergangene Nachricht derart neugierig worden, daß sie aufblieb, um ihre Rückkehr abzuwarten.\n",
      "Sie öffnete die Tür persönlich.\n",
      "Sie war eine elegante Frau mittleren Alters und ich freute mich über die Art, wie sie ihren Arm zärtlich um die Hüfte von Miss Morstar legte und wie mütterlich ihre Stimme bei der Begrüßung wurde.\n",
      "Sie war sicherlich keine einfache bezahlte Angestellte, mehr eine liebe Freundin.\n",
      "Man stellte mich vor, und Mrs. Forrester bat mich herein und forderte mich auf, unsere Abenteuer zu erzählen.\n",
      "Ich klärte sie über die Wichtigkeit meines Auftrages auf und versprach willig, ihr später jeden Fortschritt zur Aufklärung des Falles zu berichten.\n",
      "Als wir abfuhren, konnte ich einen Blick zurückwerfen und ich sah die kleine Gruppe auf den Stufen, zwei liebevoll umschlungene Figürchen, die halb geöffnete Tür, das Barometer, die hellen Treppenstufen und das durch farbiges Glas hindurchscheinende Korridorlicht.\n",
      "Dieser Blick auf eine stille englische Wohnung beruhigte mich in Anbetracht des wilden, dunklen Unternehmens, das uns aufzehrte.\n",
      "Und je mehr ich über das nachdachte, was sich bisher ereignet hatte, desto wilder und dunkler wurde es.\n",
      "Ich überprüfte die seltsame Abfolge von Ereignissen, als wir durch die gasbeleuchteten Gassen klapperten.\n",
      "Der erste Teil des Problems war zumindest gelöst.\n",
      "Der Tod von Kapitän Morgan, die Perlensendung, die Anzeige, der Brief – alle Ereignisse hatten wir beleuchtet.\n",
      "Aber alles hat uns nur noch zu tieferen und weit tragischeren Geheimnissen geführt.\n",
      "Der indische Schatz, der merkwürdige Lageplan aus Morstans Gepäck, die tragische Szene bei Major Sholtos Tod, die Wiederentdeckung des Schatzes gefolgt vom Tod des Entdeckers, die eigenartigen Begleiterscheinungen des Verbrechens, die Fußabdrücke, die ungewöhnliche Todeswaffe, die mit den Worten auf der Landkarte übereinstimmenden Worte auf dem Papier – hier gab es wirklich ein Labyrinth, in dem jemand an der Entwirrung verzweifeln könnte, der mit weniger Fähigkeiten als mein Freund ausgestattet war.\n",
      "Pinchin Lane bestand aus einer Reihe schäbiger zweistöckiger Backsteinhäuser im unteren Viertel von Lambeth.\n",
      "Ich mußte einige Mal an der Hausnummer 3 klopfen, bis ich Gehör fand.\n",
      "Endlich sah ich den Schimmer einer Kerze hinter der Jalousie und im oberen Fenster erschien ein Gesicht.\n",
      "»Hauen Sie ab, Sie alter betrunkener Landstreicher,« sagte das Gesicht. »Wenn Sie keine Ruhe geben, öffne ich die Hundezwinger und lasse dreiundvierzig Hunde auf Sie los.«\n",
      "»Sie müssen nur den einen herauslassen, für den ich gekommen bin,« sagte ich.\n",
      "»Gehen Sie weiter,« kreischte die Stimme. »Beim Barmherzigen, ich habe hier einen Totschläger, mit dem ich Ihnen eins überziehen werde, wenn Sie nicht abhauen.«\n",
      "»Aber ich will einen Hund,« rief ich.\n",
      "»Ich will kein Gerede!« rief Mr. Sherman. »Nehmen Sie sich in acht, wenn ich bis Drei gezählt habe, kriegen Sie eins drauf.«\n",
      "»Mr.\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes –« begann ich und meine Worte hatten eine magische Wirkung, denn das Fenster wurde sofort zugeschlagen und innerhalb einer Minute wurde die Tür entriegelt und geöffnet.\n",
      "Mr. Sherman war ein schlaksiger, magerer, alter Mann mit gebeugten Schultern, einem sehnigen Hals und einer blaugetönten Brille.\n",
      "»Ein Freund von Mr. Sherlock ist mir immer willkommen,« sagte er. »Treten Sie ein, Sir.\n",
      "Bleiben Sie vom Dachs weg, er beißt.\n",
      "Du Böser, du Böser, würdest du etwa einen Gentleman zwacken?« Letzteres sagte er zu einem Hermelin, der seinen boshaften Kopf mit roten Augen zwischen die Stangen seines Käfigs stieß. »Keine Sorge, Sir.\n",
      "Das ist nur ein lahmes Würmchen.\n",
      "Er hat keine Zähne mehr und ich kann ihn im Zimmer herumlaufen lassen, er frißt mir das Ungeziefer auf.\n",
      "Entschuldigung, daß ich vorhin so kurz angebunden war, aber Kinder hatten mir Streiche gespielt und es kommen viele vorbei, die mich herausklopfen wollen.\n",
      "Was wünscht Mr. Sherlock Holmes?«\n",
      "»Er wollte einen Hund von Ihnen.«\n",
      "»Aha, dann ist es Toby.«\n",
      "»Ja, Toby war der Name.«\n",
      "»Toby lebt hier links in Nummer 7.« Mit seiner Kerze bewegte er sich langsam durch die eigenartige Tierfamilie hindurch, die sich um ihn versammelt hatte.\n",
      "Aus jeder Ritze und Ecke sah ich im flackernden Lichtschein glänzende und schimmernde Augen, die auf uns starrten.\n",
      "Selbst die Dachsparren über unseren Köpfen waren von stillsitzendem Federvieh bevölkert, das träge sein Gewicht von einem Fuß zum anderen verlagerte, weil es durch unser Reden im Schlummer gestört worden war.\n",
      "Toby erwies sich als ein häßliches, langhaariges, schlappohriges Tier, halb Spaniel und halb Spürhund.\n",
      "Das Fell war braun-weiß gefärbt und er hatte einen sehr plumpen, watschelnden Gang.\n",
      "Nach einigem Zögern nahm er ein Stück Zucker an, das mir der alte Präparator gab.\n",
      "Nachdem wir so unser Bündnis besiegelt hatten, folgte er mir zur Droschke und machte mir keine weiteren Schwierigkeiten.\n",
      "Im Buckingham Palast schlug es gerade drei Uhr, als ich wieder in Pondicherry Lodge ankam.\n",
      "Der Ex-Boxer McMurdo war inzwischen als Komplize verhaftet worden.\n",
      "Er und Mr. Sholto waren zur Wache abmarschiert.\n",
      "Zwei Wachtmeister beschützten das schmale Tor, aber sie erlaubten mir, mit dem Hund vorbeizugehen, als ich den Namen des Detektivs nannte.\n",
      "Holmes stand auf der Eingangsstufe und rauchte seine Pfeife, dabei hatte er beide Hände in den Taschen vergraben.\n",
      "»Ah, da haben Sie ihn ja,« sagte er. »Gutes Hundchen!\n",
      "Atheney Jones ist fort.\n",
      "Seit Sie gingen, haben wir uns mit einiger Vehemenz aneinander gerieben.\n",
      "Er hat nicht nur unseren Freund Thaddeus festgenommen, sondern auch den Pförtner, die Haushälterin und den indischen Diener.\n",
      "Mit Ausnahme eines Wachtmeisters im oberen Stockwerk haben wir diesen Ort nun für uns.\n",
      "Lassen Sie den Hund hier und kommen Sie mit hinauf.«\n",
      "Wir banden Toby an ein Tischbein und stiegen erneut die Treppe hinauf.\n",
      "Das Zimmer war genauso, wie es verlassen worden war.\n",
      "Nur ein Laken war über die Person geworfen worden, um die sich alles drehte.\n",
      "Ein müde aussehender Polizist hatte sich in eine Ecke zurückgezogen.\n",
      "»Wachtmeister, sehen Sie her!« sagte mein Begleiter. »Und nun binden Sie dieses Stück Pappe um meinen Hals, so daß es vor mir hängt.\n",
      "Danke!\n",
      "Jetzt muß ich meine Stiefel und Strümpfe ausziehen.\n",
      "– Nehmen Sie sie mit hinunter, Watson.\n",
      "Ich werde jetzt ein wenig klettern.\n",
      "Und tupfen Sie mein Taschentuch in das Kreosot.\n",
      "Das ist genug.\n",
      "Nun kommen Sie einen Moment mit in die Dachstube.«\n",
      "Wir kletterten durch das Loch hinauf.\n",
      "Holmes zeigt mit der Lampe erneut auf die Fußstapfen im Staub.\n",
      "»Ich möchte, daß Sie sich diese Abdrücke genau einprägen,« sagte er. »Finden Sie etwas Beachtenswertes daran?«\n",
      "»Sie stammen von einer Frau oder einem Kind,« sagte ich.\n",
      "»Ich meinte es nicht wegen der Größe.\n",
      "Gibt es sonst nichts?«\n",
      "»Sie sind beinahe ebenso, wie andere Fußabdrücke auch aussehen.«\n",
      "»Nicht exakt.\n",
      "Sehen Sie hierher!\n",
      "Dies ist der Abdruck eines rechten Fußes im Staub.\n",
      "Nun mache ich einen mit meinem nackten Fuß genau daneben.\n",
      "Was ist der Hauptunterschied?«\n",
      "»Ihre Zehen stehen alle dicht zusammen.\n",
      "Der andere Abdruck zeigt jede Zehe einzeln.«\n",
      "»So ist es.\n",
      "Das ist der entscheidende Punkt.\n",
      "Merken Sie sich das.\n",
      "Würden Sie jetzt bitte dort zum Fenster gehen und am Holzrahmen riechen?\n",
      "Ich bleibe hier, denn ich habe das Taschentuch in der Hand.«\n",
      "Ich tat wie er mir befahl und bemerkte sofort einen starken Geruch nach Teer.\n",
      "»Dorthin hat er seinen Fuß beim Hinausklettern gesetzt.\n",
      "Wenn Sie die Spur riechen, wird Toby keine Schwierigkeiten damit haben.\n",
      "Gehen Sie hinunter, lassen Sie den Hund frei und sehen Sie nach Blondin.«\n",
      "Während ich zum Erdgeschoß hinunterging, war Sherlock Holmes bereits auf dem Dach.\n",
      "Ich konnte ihn wie ein riesiges Glühwürmchen langsam am Dachfirst entlangklettern sehen.\n",
      "Hinter einer Reihe von Schornsteinen verlor ich ihn aus den Augen, dann erschien er plötzlich wieder und verschwand erneut auf der gegenüberliegenden Seite.\n",
      "Als ich um das Haus herumging, saß er nahe einem Dachüberhang.\n",
      "»Sind Sie es, Watson,« rief er.\n",
      "»Ja.«\n",
      "»Hier ist es.\n",
      "Was ist dort für ein schwarzer Gegenstand?«\n",
      "»Eine Wassertonne.«\n",
      "»Mit Deckel?«\n",
      "»Ja.«\n",
      "»Keine Leiter in der Nähe?«\n",
      "»Nein.«\n",
      "»Verdammter Kerl!\n",
      "Ein halsbrecherischer Ort.\n",
      "Ich versuche dort herunterzukommen, wo er hinaufgeklettert ist.\n",
      "Das Wasserrohr scheint sehr stabil zu sein.\n",
      "Naja, auf geht's.«\n",
      "Man hörte ein Fußscharren und die Laterne kam langsam an der Seite der Wand hinunter.\n",
      "Mit einem letzten Satz sprang er aufs Faß und von dort zu Boden.\n",
      "»Ich konnte ihm einfach folgen,« sagte er und zog sich Strümpfe und Stiefel wieder an. »Auf der ganzen Strecke waren die Ziegel locker und in der Eile hat er dies hier verloren.\n",
      "Meine Diagnose ist bestätigt, wie Sie Herren Doktoren es auszudrücken pflegen.«\n",
      "Der Gegenstand, den er mir hinhielt, war eine kleine Tasche oder ein Beutel, aus farbigen Gräsern gewebt und mit einigen kitschig-bunten Perlenschnüren umwickelt.\n",
      "In Form und Größe war er einer Zigarettendose ähnlich.\n",
      "Darin befanden sich ein halbes Dutzend Dornen aus dunklem Holz, am einen Ende scharf und am andern Ende abgerundet, genau wie jener, der Bartholomew Sholto getroffen hatte.\n",
      "»Das sind teuflische Dinger,« sagte er. »Passen Sie auf, daß Sie sich nicht stechen.\n",
      "Ich bin froh, daß ich sie jetzt habe.\n",
      "Denn es kann sein, daß er keine weiteren mehr hat.\n",
      "Sonst hätten wir sie vielleicht früher oder später in unserer Haut stecken.\n",
      "Vor einer Standgerichtskugel hätte ich mich sicherer gefühlt.\n",
      "Sind Sie für einen Marsch von sechs Meilen gerüstet, Watson?«\n",
      "»Natürlich,« antwortete ich.\n",
      "»Wird es Ihr Bein aushalten?«\n",
      "»Ja, sicher.«\n",
      "»Auf geht's Hundchen!\n",
      "Guter alter Toby!\n",
      "Riech, Toby, riech!« Er hielt dem Hund das mit Kreosot getränkte Taschentuch unter die Nase.\n",
      "Der Hund stand mit seinen wuscheligen, abgewinkelten Beinen da und hielt seinen Kopf wie ein Weinkenner, der das Bouquet eines berühmten Jahrgangs kostet.\n",
      "Holmes warf das Taschentuch ein Stück voraus, befestigte eine feste Schnur am Hals der Promenadenmischung und führte ihn an den Fuß der Wassertonne.\n",
      "Das Tier sieß sofort ein hohes, quietschendes Jaulen aus.\n",
      "Mit der Nase am Boden und dem Schwanz in der Höhe folgte er der Spur in einem Tempo, das die Leine spannte und uns auf Höchstgeschwindigkeit brachte.\n",
      "Im Osten wurde es allmählich hell und wir konnten im kalten grauen Licht ein Stück vorausschauen.\n",
      "Das quadratische, hohe Haus mit seinen schwarzen, leeren Fenstern und den hohen, nackten Mauern ragte traurig und verlassen hinter uns auf.\n",
      "Unser Kurs führte uns direkt durch den Park, hinein und hinaus aus den Gräben und Gruben, von denen er durchschnitten wurde.\n",
      "Der ganze Ort mit seinen verstreuten Hügeln und kränklichen Sträuchern hatte ein schicksalbehaftestes Aussehen, genau wie die dunkle Tragödie, die über ihm lag.\n",
      "Als wir die Grenzmauer erreichten, rannte Toby an ihr entlang und jaulte heftig.\n",
      "Im Schatten der Mauer hielt er schließlich an einer Ecke, die von einer jungen Buche verdeckt wurde.\n",
      "Dort wo sich die beiden Mauern trafen, waren mehrere Steine herausgenommen worden und die dadurch erzeugten Mauerlücken sahen aus, als ob man sie öfter wie eine Leiter benutzt hatte.\n",
      "Holmes kletterte hinauf, nahm von mir den Hund entgegen und setzte ihn auf der anderen Seite ab.\n",
      "»Hier ist ein Abdruck vom Holzbein,« bemerkte er, als ich neben ihn heraufkam. »Man sieht den kleinen Blutfleck auf dem hellen Mörtel.\n",
      "Welch ein Glück, daß wir seit gestern keinen starken Regen hatten!\n",
      "Der Geruch bleibt im Boden, trotz der achtundzwanzig dazwischenliegenden Stunden.«\n",
      "Ich gestehe, daß auch ich Zweifel hatte, als ich an den starken Verkehr dachte, der in der Zwischenzeit über die Londoner Straßen gerollt war.\n",
      "Meine Angst wurde jedoch bald beschwichtigt.\n",
      "Toby schwankte oder zögerte nicht, sondern watschelte in der ihm eigenen Art weiter.\n",
      "Eindeutig überwog der Kreosotgeruch alle anderen konkurrierenden Düfte.\n",
      "»Glauben Sie nicht,« sagte Holmes, »daß mein Erfolg von der bloßen Chance abhängt, daß einer dieser Typen seinen Fuß in die Chemikalie gestellt hat.\n",
      "Ich weiß mittlerweile genug, um sie auf viele andere Arten zu verfolgen.\n",
      "Dies ist aber die geeignetste Art, und weil uns das Glück dabei half, wäre ich dumm, wenn ich es nicht nutze.\n",
      "Dadurch ist der Fall aber zu einer kleineren intellektuellen Aufgabe geworden, als ich Ihnen früher versprach.«\n",
      "»Ich versichere Ihnen,« sagte ich, »daß ich staune, mit welchen Mitteln Sie die Ergebnisse in diesem Fall gewonnen haben.\n",
      "Noch viel mehr als im Jefferson Hope Mordfall.\n",
      "Hier erscheint mir alles viel verborgener und unerklärlicher zu sein.\n",
      "Wie haben Sie zum Beispiel den Mann mit dem Holzbein so genau beschreiben können?«\n",
      "»Pah, mein lieber Mann!\n",
      "Er war sehr simpel.\n",
      "Ich möchte nicht theatralisch sein.\n",
      "Es ist liegt offen auf der Hand.\n",
      "Zwei zu einer Strafkolonie abkommandierte Offiziere erfahren das Geheimnis eines verborgenen Schatzes.\n",
      "Ein Engländer namens Jonathan Small zeichnet für sie einen Lageplan.\n",
      "Sie erinnern sich, daß wir den Namen auf der Karte aus Kapitän Morgans Besitz fanden.\n",
      "Er hatte sie für sich und seine Verbündeten unterschrieben – das Zeichen der Vier, wie er es etwas dramatisch nannte.\n",
      "Mit Hilfe dieser Karte haben die Offiziere – oder einer von ihnen – den Schatz gehoben und nach England gebracht.\n",
      "Und hat ihn aus uns noch unbekannten Gründen nicht angerührt.\n",
      "Aber warum hat Jonathan Small den Schatz nicht selber genommen?\n",
      "Es gibt nur eine Antwort.\n",
      "Die Karte trägt ein Datum aus der Zeit, als Morstan in einen direkten Zusammenhang mit den Gefangenen gebracht werden konnte.\n",
      "Jonathan Small konnte den Schatz nicht heben, weil er und seine Genossen noch Gefangene waren und nicht fortkommen konnten.«\n",
      "»Aber das ist bloße Spekulation,« sagte ich.\n",
      "»Es ist mehr als das.\n",
      "Es ist die einzige Hypothese, die sich mit den Tatsachen deckt.\n",
      "Wollen wir sehen, wie es sich mit der weiteren Abfolge verhält.\n",
      "Major Sholto verhält sich für einige Jahre ruhig und freut sich über den Besitz des Schatzes.\n",
      "Dann erhält er einen Brief aus Indien, der ihm einen großen Schrecken einjagt.\n",
      "Was war es?«\n",
      "»Ein Brief mit der Mitteilung, daß die Männer die er betrogen hatte, freigelassen worden sind.«\n",
      "»Oder entflohen waren.\n",
      "Das ist wahrscheinlicher, denn er kannte sicherlich die Dauer ihrer Inhaftierung.\n",
      "Das wäre für ihn keine Überraschung gewesen.\n",
      "Was tat er dann?\n",
      "Er schützte sich vor einem Mann mit Holzbein – einen Weißen, denn er verwechselte einen weißen Händler mit ihm und schoß auf diesen.\n",
      "Nun, es war aber nur der Name eines Weißen auf der Karte.\n",
      "Die anderen waren Hindus oder Mohammedaner.\n",
      "Es gab keinen anderen Weißen.\n",
      "Deshalb können wir mit Gewißheit sagen, daß der Holzbeinige mit Jonathan Small identisch ist.\n",
      "Kommt Ihnen diese Folgerung falsch vor?«\n",
      "»Nein: sie ist klar und einleuchtend.«\n",
      "»Gut, dann versetzen wir uns an die Stelle von Jonathan Small.\n",
      "Schauen wir es uns von seinem Standpunkt aus an.\n",
      "Er kam mit zwei Absichten nach England.\n",
      "Er wollte das wiedererlangen, was ihm gehört und Rache an dem Mann nehmen, der ihn betrogen hatte.\n",
      "Er fand Sholtos Aufenthaltsort heraus und hat sehr wahrscheinlich mit irgend jemandem aus dem Haus Verbindung aufgenommen.\n",
      "Es gibt diesen Butler, Lal Rao, den wir noch nicht gesehen haben.\n",
      "Mrs. Bernstone bescheinigt ihm keinen guten Charakter.\n",
      "Small konnte jedoch nicht herausfinden, wo der Schatz versteckt war.\n",
      "Denn keiner kannte den Ort außer dem Major und einem treuen Diener, der verstorben ist.\n",
      "Plötzlich erfährt Small, daß der Major auf seinem Totenbett liegt.\n",
      "In größter Aufregung, daß das Geheimnis des Schatzes mit ihm stirbt, nimmt er die Beine unter den Arm und kommt zum Fenster des Sterbenden.\n",
      "Am Eintreten hindert ihn nur die Anwesenheit der beiden Söhne.\n",
      "Haßerfüllt gegen den toten Mann geht er nachts in das Zimmer und durchsucht die Privatpapiere, in der Hoffnung, eine den Schatz betreffende Notiz zu finden.\n",
      "Letztlich hinterläßt er eine gekritzelte Erinnerung an seinen Besuch auf dem Kartonschnipsel.\n",
      "Zweifellos hatte er schon vorher geplant, daß er diese oder eine ähnliche Nachricht beim Major ließe, wenn er ihn ermordet hätte, nur um zu zeigen, daß es kein gewöhnlicher Mord, sondern aus der Sicht der vier Verbündeten eine Art von Gerichtsbarkeit war.\n",
      "Schrullige und bizarre Eitelkeiten dieser Art sind in den Annalen des Verbrechens oft genug zu finden und geben normalerweise wertvolle Aufschlüsse über den Täter.\n",
      "Konnten Sie soweit folgen?«\n",
      "»Sehr gut.«\n",
      "»Und was konnte Jonathan Small jetzt tun?\n",
      "Er konnte nur aus dem Verborgenen die Versuche zur Auffindung des Schatzes verfolgen.\n",
      "Möglicherweise verließ er England und kam nur gelegentlich zurück.\n",
      "Dann folgte die Entdeckung der Dachkammer und er wurde sofort darüber informiert.\n",
      "Wiederum müssen wir die Spur eines Verbündeten im Haushalt verfolgen.\n",
      "Mit seinem Holzbein ist es Jonathan total unmöglich, das obere Zimmer von Bartholomew Sholto zu erreichen.\n",
      "Er hatte aber einen sehr seltsamen Partner dabei, der diese Schwierigkeiten zwar überwinden konnte, der aber mit seinen nackten Füßen in das Kreosot tappte.\n",
      "Und nun kommen Toby und sechs Meilen Humpeln für einen Chirurgen mit halber Stelle und einer lädierten Achillessehne.«\n",
      "»Aber dann war es der Kumpane und nicht Jonathan, der das Verbrechen beging.«\n",
      "»So ist es.\n",
      "Und sehr zu Jonathans Mißvergnügen, denken Sie daran wie er aufstampfte, als er das Zimmer betrat.\n",
      "Er hegte keinen Groll gegen Jonathan Sholto, er hätte ihn lieber gebunden und geknebelt.\n",
      "Er wollte keine Schlinge um seinen eigenen Kopf bekommen.\n",
      "Aber er konnte nicht mehr helfen: die wilden Instinkte seines Begleiters waren ausgebrochen und das Gift hatte seine Wirkung erzielt.\n",
      "Daher verließ Jonathan den Ort, ließ die Schatzkiste zum Boden hinunter und folgte selbst.\n",
      "Das war die Folge von Ereignissen, soweit ich sie entziffern konnte.\n",
      "Und zu seinem Aussehen: er mußte mittleren Alters und sonnengebräunt sein, wenn er seine Zeit in einem solchen Ofen wie den Andamanen verbracht hatte.\n",
      "Seine Größe läßt sich einfach aus der Schrittlänge errechnen und wir wußten, daß er bärtig war.\n",
      "Seine Behaartheit war das einzige, das Thaddeus Sholto auffiel, als er ihn am Fenster sah.\n",
      "Ich glaube, mehr Fakten gibt es nun nicht.«\n",
      "»Der Verbündete?«\n",
      "»Oh ja, aber das ist kein großes Rätsel.\n",
      "Bald werden Sie alles darüber erfahren.\n",
      "Wie lieblich ist doch die Morgenluft!\n",
      "Sehen Sie, diese kleine Wolke schwebt wie die rosa Feder eines riesigen Flamingos.\n",
      "Jetzt schiebt sich der rote Rand der Sonne über die Wolkenbänke von London.\n",
      "Sie scheint jetzt auf eine Menge Leute, aber niemand von denen hat einen seltsameren Auftrag als wir beide zu erledigen.\n",
      "Wie klein wir doch mit unseren geringen Bestrebungen sind im Angesicht solch elementarer Mächte der Natur!\n",
      "Sind Sie mit Ihrem Jean Paul weitergekommen?«\n",
      "»So einigermaßen.\n",
      "Ich bin auf ihn über Carlyle gestoßen.«\n",
      "»Wie man einem Bach bis zum See folgt.\n",
      "Er machte eine seltsame aber tiefgründige Bemerkung.\n",
      "Er sagt, daß der beste Beweis der wirklichen Größe eines Mannes im Erkennen seiner eigenen Kleinheit liegt.\n",
      "Hier streiten sich Vergleich und Würdigung, was wiederum ein Zeichen von Würde ist.\n",
      "Bei Richter finden sich viele Dinge zum Nachdenken.\n",
      "Haben Sie eine Pistole?«\n",
      "»Ich habe meinen Stock.«\n",
      "»Es ist möglich, daß wir so etwas brauchen, wenn wir zu ihrem Lager kommen.\n",
      "Ich überlasse Ihnen Jonathan, aber wenn der andere gemein wird, schieße ich ihn über den Haufen.« Beim Sprechen zog er seinen Revolver, und nachdem er beide Kammern geladen hatte, steckte er ihn in die rechte Tasche seiner Jacke zurück.\n",
      "Während der ganzen Zeit wurden wir von Toby durch die ländlichen, mit Villen besetzten Straßen geleitet, die zur Metropole führten.\n",
      "Nun kamen wir aber auf glattere Straßen, auf denen Arbeiter und Seeleute auf den Beinen waren.\n",
      "Unordentlich gekleidete Frauen nahmen die Fensterläden ab und putzten die Treppen.\n",
      "An einer Ecke öffneten bereits die Läden und grobschlächtige Männer kamen heraus, ihre von der Morgenwäsche feuchten Bärte mit den Hemdsärmeln abtrocknend.\n",
      "Streunende Hunde stromerten herum und starrten uns verwundert an.\n",
      "Aber unser unbeirrbarer Toby schaute weder nach links noch nach rechts und trottete mit seiner Nase am Boden vorwärts, nur unterbrochen von einem gelegentliche Jaulen, das die wiedergefundene Fährte signalisierte.\n",
      "Wir hatten Streatham, Brixton und Camberwell durchquert und befanden uns nun in der Kennington Lane und hatten uns durch die Seitenstraßen nach Osten bewegt.\n",
      "Die von uns Verfolgten schienen einen seltsamen Zickzackweg genommen zu haben, vielleicht wollten sie der Verfolgung entkommen.\n",
      "Nie benutzten sie eine Hauptstraße, wenn parallele Seitenstraßen zum gleichen Ziel führten.\n",
      "Am Beginn der Kennington Lane hatten sie sich nach links durch die Bond Street und Miles Street bewegt.\n",
      "Wo letzere in Knight's Place übergeht, beendete Toby das Vorwärtsdrängen und begann vor und zurück zu laufen, mit einem gespitzten und einem herunterhängenden Ohr.\n",
      "Das typische Bild eines unentschlossenen Hundes.\n",
      "Dann watschelte er im Kreis, schaute bisweilen zu uns auf, als wollte er um Verständnis für seine Unentschlossenheit bitten.\n",
      "»Was ist mit dem Hund los?« knurrte Holmes. »Sie haben bestimmt keine Droschke genommen oder sind im einem Ballon davongeflogen.«\n",
      "»Vielleicht standen sie hier eine Weile,« schlug ich vor.\n",
      "»Ach, es ist in Ordnung.\n",
      "Weiter geht's,« sagte mein Begleiter mit Erleichterung.\n",
      "Und tatsächlich zog er los, denn nach einem kurzen Herumschnüffeln entschied er sich plötzlich und flitzte mit einer Energie und Entschlossenheit davon, wie er sie bisher noch nicht an den Tag gelegt hatte.\n",
      "Die Fährte schien viel frischer als zuvor zu sein, denn er hielt die Nase nicht am Boden, sondern zerrte an seiner Leine und versuchte davonzurennen.\n",
      "Am Glanz in Holmes Augen konnte ich erkennen, daß er das Ende der Reise erwartete.\n",
      "Unsere Route ging jetzt Nine Elms hinunter bis wir das großen Nelsonsche Holzlager erreichten, das dicht hinter dem Gasthaus Eagle lag.\n",
      "Hier zwängte sich der aufgeregte Hund durch das Seitentor in das umzäunte Gelände, auf dem die Sägearbeiter bereits bei der Arbeit waren.\n",
      "Der Hund lief durch Sägemehl und Holzspäne auf eine Gasse zu, dann durch eine Passage aus zwei Holzstapeln und sprang zuletzt mit triumphierendem Jaulen auf ein großes Faß, das noch nicht vom Handkarren heruntergenommen war.\n",
      "Mit hechelnder Zunge und blitzenden Augen stand Toby auf dem Faß und sah von einem zum andern und wartete auf ein Zeichen des Lobes.\n",
      "Die Faßdauben und auch die Räder des Karrens waren mit einer dunklen Flüssigkeit beschmiert und die Luft war vom Geruch von Kreosot geschwängert.\n",
      "Wir sahen uns stumm an und brachen dann in ein unkontrolliertes Lachen aus.\n",
      "Die Baker Street Gang\n",
      "»Was nun,« fragte ich. »Toby hat seine Unfehlbarkeit verloren.«\n",
      "»Er folgte seinen Eingebungen,« sagte Holmes, hob ihm vom Faß und verließ mit ihm den Hof der Holzhandlung. »Denken Sie daran, wieviel Kreosot täglich durch London gekarrt wird.\n",
      "Es ist kein Wunder, wenn sich die Spuren gekreuzt haben.\n",
      "Zur Zeit des Holzeinschlags wird es besonders häufig verwendet.\n",
      "Wir können den armen Toby dafür nicht verantwortlich machen.«\n",
      "»Dann müssen wir zur Hauptfährte zurück, denke ich.«\n",
      "»Ja, und glücklicherweise ist es nicht weit.\n",
      "Offensichtlich wurde der Hund an der Ecke Knight's Place verwirrt, als sich zwei Fährten in entgegengesetzte Richtungen fortsetzten.\n",
      "Wir sind der falschen gefolgt.\n",
      "Dann müssen wir bloß der anderen folgen.«\n",
      "Das war einfach.\n",
      "Wir führten Toby zu dem Ort, an dem er seinen Fehler machte, er lief einen großen Kreis und schoß plötzlich in eine neue Richtung.\n",
      "»Wir müssen aufpassen, daß er uns nicht dorthin bringt, wo das Kreosotfaß herkommt,« bemerkte ich.\n",
      "»Daran habe ich auch gedacht.\n",
      "Aber sehen Sie, er bleibt auf dem Bürgersteig; das Faß ist aber auf der Straße transportiert worden.\n",
      "Nein, jetzt sind wir auf der richtigen Fährte.«\n",
      "Sie führte zum Flußufer hinunter, durch Belmont Place und Prince's Street hindurch.\n",
      "Am Ende der Broad Street ging es direkt zum Flußufer hinunter.\n",
      "Dort gab es einen kleinen hölzernen Steg.\n",
      "Toby führte uns an sein äußerstes Ende und blieb dort winselnd stehen und sah auf die dunklen Fluten unter sich.\n",
      "»Wir haben Glück,« sagte Holmes. »Sie haben hier ein Boot bestiegen.« Mehrere kleine Boote zum Staken und auch Ruderboote lagen im Wasser und auch am Rand des Steges.\n",
      "Wir führten Toby bei jedem vorbei, aber trotz gewissenhafter Schnüffelei gab er uns kein Signal.\n",
      "In der Nähe dieser behelfsmäßigen Landestelle stand ein kleines Backsteinhaus, im zweiten Fenster hing ein Plakat mit der Aufschrift ›Mordecai Smith‹ in großen Lettern, und darunter ›Bootsverleih für Stunden oder Tage‹.\n",
      "Über der Tür informierte eine zweite Inschrift, daß es hier eine Dampfbarkasse gab; ein großer Haufen Koks an der Pier bestätigte diese Aussage.\n",
      "Holmes blickte langsam in die Runde und sein Blick war unheilverkündend.\n",
      "»Das sieht schlecht aus,« sagte er. »Das sind schärfere Hunde als ich dachte.\n",
      "Sie haben ihre Spuren verwischt.\n",
      "Ich fürchte, hier war etwas im Voraus abgesprochen.«\n",
      "Er näherte sich der Haustür, die sich plötzlich öffnete und ein kleiner, lockenköpfiger Knirps von etwa sechs Jahren kam herausgerannt.\n",
      "Ihm lief eine stämmige Frau mit hochrotem Gesicht und einem Schwamm in der Hand hinterher.\n",
      "»Komm zurück und laß dich waschen, Jack,« rief sie. »Komm zurück, du kleiner Kobold.\n",
      "Wenn dein Vater zurückkommt, wir er dir schon etwas erzählen, wenn er dich so antrifft.«\n",
      "»Mein lieber Junge,« sagte Holmes taktisch klug. »Du kleiner Schlingel mit rosa Bäckchen!\n",
      "Sag mir, Jack, gibt es etwas, das Du gerne haben möchtest?«\n",
      "Der Junge dachte einen Moment nach.\n",
      "»Ich will 'nen Schilling,« sagte er.\n",
      "»Und was möchtest Du noch lieber?«\n",
      "»Noch lieber will ich zwei Shilling,« antwortete das Wunderkind nach kurzem Nachdenken.\n",
      "»Hier hast Du sie, fang!\n",
      "– Ein nettes Kind, Mrs. Smith!«\n",
      "»Gott segne Sie, Sir.\n",
      "Er ist mehr als nett, fast mehr als mir lieb ist, besonders wenn mein Mann für einige Tage fort ist.«\n",
      "»Ist er nicht da?« sagte Holmes mit enttäuschter Stimme. »Schade, ich wollte mit Mr. Smith sprechen.«\n",
      "»Er ist seit gestern morgen weg, Sir, und um die Wahrheit zu sagen habe ich ein wenig Angst um ihn.\n",
      "Aber wenn Sie ein Boot möchten, Sir, kann auch ich Ihnen helfen.«\n",
      "»Ich möchte die Dampfbarkasse mieten.«\n",
      "»Sir, er ist leider mit der Barkasse unterwegs.\n",
      "Genau das macht mir Sorgen, denn es waren nicht genügend Kohlen an Bord, um sie nach Woolwich und hierher zurück zu fahren.\n",
      "Wenn er im Lastkahn unterwegs wäre, hätte ich mir nichts dabei gedacht, denn oft hat ihn ein Auftrag bis nach Gravesend geführt und wenn es dort viel zu tun gegeben hat, ist er dort eine Weile geblieben.\n",
      "Aber eine Dampfbarkasse ohne Kohlen?«\n",
      "»Er kann doch welche an den Kais am Fluß gekauft haben.«\n",
      "»Er könnte, Sir, aber er fuhr nicht in diese Richtung.\n",
      "Ich habe sie einige Zeit über den Preis für einige seltsame Taschen feilschen gehört.\n",
      "Übrigens mag ich den Mann mit dem Holzbein nicht, er hat ein häßliches Gesicht und redet seltsam.\n",
      "Warum hat er dauernd bei uns angeklopft?«\n",
      "»Ein Mann mit Holzbein?« rief Holmes in völliger Überraschung.\n",
      "»Ja, Sir, ein dunkelhäutiger, affengesichtiger Kerl hat mehr als einmal nach meinem Mann gefragt.\n",
      "Er war es, der uns gestern Nacht aufweckte.\n",
      "Und mein Mann hat ihn anscheinend erwartet, denn er hatte die Barkasse unter Dampf gesetzt.\n",
      "Ich sage es Ihnen gerade heraus, Sir, ich habe kein gutes Gefühl dabei.«\n",
      "»Aber liebe Mrs. Smith,« sagte Holmes und zuckte mit den Schultern. »Sie regen sich umsonst auf.\n",
      "Woher wissen Sie denn, daß es der Mann mit dem Holzbein war, der in der Nacht kam?\n",
      "Wie können Sie da so sicher sein?«\n",
      "»Seine Stimme, Sir.\n",
      "Ich kenne seine Stimme.\n",
      "Sie ist etwas belegt und verschwommen.\n",
      "Er klopfte etwa um drei Uhr früh.\n",
      "›Komm raus, Kumpel‹, sagte er, ›Zeit um auf Wache zu gehen.\n",
      "‹ Mein Mann weckte Jim auf – das ist unser Ältester – und fort waren sie, ohne mir nur ein Wort zu sagen.\n",
      "Ich habe das Holzbein auf den Steinen klappern gehört.«\n",
      "»Und war der Einbeinige allein?«\n",
      "»Kann ich nicht mit Sicherheit sagen, Sir.\n",
      "Ich habe sonst niemanden gehört.«\n",
      "»Schade, Mrs. Smith.\n",
      "Ich hätte gern die Barkasse gehabt, denn ich habe nur gutes über die – wie war noch der Name?«\n",
      "»Die Aurora, Sir.«\n",
      "»Ah!\n",
      "Ist es nicht die grüne Barkasse mit dem gelben Streifen und etwas breiter als üblich?«\n",
      "»Nein keineswegs, sie ist ein schmaleres Boot als viele andere.\n",
      "Sie ist neu gestrichen, schwarz mit zwei roten Streifen.«\n",
      "»Danke.\n",
      "Ich denke, Sie werden bald von Ihrem Mann etwas hören.\n",
      "Ich gehe flußabwärts und falls ich etwas von der Aurora sehe, werde ich ihrem Mann sagen, daß Sie sich sorgen.\n",
      "Sagten Sie, es sei ein schwarzer Schornstein?«\n",
      "»Nein Sir, schwarz mit einem weißen Band.«\n",
      "»Ach natürlich.\n",
      "Die Seiten waren schwarz.\n",
      "Guten Morgen, Mrs. Smith.\n",
      "Hier ist ein Bootsverleiher mit einer Fähre, Watson.\n",
      "Wir sollten sie nehmen, um nach drüben zu kommen.«\n",
      "»Bei solchen Leuten ist es am wichtigsten,« sagte Holmes als wir im Fährboot saßen, »daß sie immer denken, ihre Information sei völlig unwichtig für andere.\n",
      "Sonst werden sie sich wie eine Auster verschließen.\n",
      "Wenn Sie nur mit Vorbehalt zuhören, erhalten Sie viel eher das, was sie haben wollen.«\n",
      "»Nun scheint mir unser Kurs klar zu sein,« sagte ich.\n",
      "»Was würden Sie denn tun?«\n",
      "»Ich würde eine Barkasse mieten und flußabwärts nach einer Spur der Aurora suchen.«\n",
      "»Lieber Freund, das wäre eine kolossale Arbeit.\n",
      "Sie kann nahezu an jeder Pier auf jeder Seite des Flusses von hier bis nach Greenwich angelegt haben.\n",
      "Hinter der Brücke gibt es ein meilenweites perfektes Labyrinth von Landeplätzen.\n",
      "Wenn Sie alle allein untersuchen wollten, würde es mehrere Tage dauern.«\n",
      "»Dann lassen wir es die Polizei machen.«\n",
      "»Nein, Athelny Jones würde ich wahrscheinlich nur im letzten Augenblick rufen.\n",
      "Er ist kein schlechter Kerl, und ich möchte nichts tun, was seiner Berufsehre schaden könnte.\n",
      "Ich ziehe vor, das ich es selbst herausfinde, wo wir nun schon so weit vorangekommen sind.«\n",
      "»Könnten wir uns nicht Informationen von den Kaimeistern holen?«\n",
      "»Noch schlechter!\n",
      "Unsere Leute wüßten sofort, daß wir ihnen auf den Fersen sind und sie würden schnell das Land verlassen.\n",
      "Das werden sie sowieso vorhaben, aber sie sind in keiner Eile, solange sie sich vollkommen sicher fühlen.\n",
      "Jones' Energie wird für uns arbeiten, denn seine Ansicht über diesen Fall wird er bestimmt in die Tageszeitung setzen lassen.\n",
      "Und die Flüchtigen glauben dann, alle Verfolger befinden sich auf der falschen Fährte.«\n",
      "»Was machen wir dann,« fragte ich als wir in der Nähe von Milbank Penitenary an Land gingen.\n",
      "»Nehmen Sie diese Kutsche, fahren Sie nach Hause, frühstücken Sie und legen Sie sich für eine Stunde hin.\n",
      "Es ist zu befürchten, daß wir heute Nacht wieder auf den Beinen sind.\n",
      "Fahrer, halten Sie beim Telegrafenamt!\n",
      "Wir werden Toby bei uns behalten, denn er kann uns später noch nützlich sein.«\n",
      "Wir hielten am Postamt in der Great Peter Street und Holmes gab sein Telegramm auf.\n",
      "»An wen schrieb ich es wohl?« fragte er, als wir unsere Reise fortsetzten.\n",
      "»Ich weiß es wirklich nicht.«\n",
      "»Erinnern Sie sich an die Baker Street Polizeitruppe, die ich im Jefferson Hope Fall einsetzte?«\n",
      "»Sicher,« sagte ich lachend.\n",
      "»In unserem Fall sind sie geradezu unbezahlbar.\n",
      "Ich werde es zuerst mit ihnen versuchen, und wenn sie versagen, habe ich noch andere Quellen.\n",
      "Diese Telegramm ging an meinen kleinen niederträchtigen Leutnant Wiggins.\n",
      "Er und seine Gang werden bei uns sein, bevor wir unser Frühstück beendet haben.«\n",
      "Es war jetzt zwischen acht und neun Uhr und ich spürte die Reaktion meines Körpers auf die ununterbrochenen Aufregungen der letzten Nacht.\n",
      "Ich war schlapp und müde, geistig leicht verwirrt und körperlich erschöpft.\n",
      "Die berufsmäßige Begeisterung, die mein Gefährte immer noch besaß, hatte mich verlassen; auch konnte ich den ganzen Fall nicht mehr als ein abstraktes intellektuelles Problem betrachten.\n",
      "Was den Tod von Bartholomew Sholto betraf, ich hatte vorher wenig Gutes über ihn gehört und ich hatte keine sehr große Antipathie gegen seine Mörder.\n",
      "Der Schatz war allerdings eine andere Sache.\n",
      "Er, oder zumindestens ein Teil von ihm, gehörte Miss Morstan.\n",
      "Solange es die Möglichkeit gab ihn zu finden, würde ich mein Leben dafür hergeben.\n",
      "Wenn ich ihn fände, würde sie allerdings für mich nicht mehr erreichbar sein.\n",
      "Aber es wäre eine kleinliche und egoistische Liebe, wenn sie von solchen Gedanken beeinflußt werden könnte.\n",
      "Während Holmes sich mit dem Aufspüren der Verbrecher beschäftigte, hatte ich einen zehnfach stärkeren Grund, der mich zur Suche nach dem Schatz antrieb.\n",
      "Ein Bad in der Baker Street und der Wechsel meiner gesamten Bekleidung frischte mich wunderbar auf.\n",
      "Als ich in unser Zimmer kam, fand ich das Frühstück zubereitet und Holmes goß mir Kaffee ein.\n",
      "»Hier ist es,« sagte er lachend und zeigte auf eine aufgeschlagene Zeitung. »Der energische Jones und der allgegenwärtige Reporter haben es unter sich ausgemacht.\n",
      "Aber Sie haben bestimmt genug vom Fall.\n",
      "Aber noch nicht genug Ham und Egg.«\n",
      "Ich nahm die Zeitung und las die kurze Nachricht, die »Mysteriöse Geschichte in Upper Norwood« betitelt war.\n",
      "Im Standard stand folgendes: »Gestern gegen zwölf Uhr nachts wurde Mr. Bartholomew Sholto von der Pondicherry Lodge, Upper Norwood, tot in seinem Zimmer aufgefunden.\n",
      "Wie wir erfuhren, sind keine Spuren von Gewaltanwendung an der Person gefunden worden.\n",
      "Jedoch wurde eine wertvolle Edelsteinsammlung entwendet, die der Verstorbene von seinem Vater geerbt hatte.\n",
      "Mr. Sherlock Holmes und Dr. Watson entdeckten den Toten als erste.\n",
      "Sie kamen mit Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, dem Bruder des Verstorbenen, zum Haus.\n",
      "Durch viele glückliche Umstände war Mr. Athelney Jones, der bekannte Detektiv, zufällig auf der Polizeiwache von Norwood.\n",
      "Weniger als eine halbe Stunde nach Eingang der Meldung war er am Tatort.\n",
      "Sein geschulter Verstand und seine Erfahrung führten schnell zur Entdeckung der Schuldigen.\n",
      "Es ist erfreulich zu berichten, daß folgende Festnahmen bereits erfolgten: der Bruder, Thaddeus Sholto zusammen mit seiner Haushälterin, Mrs. Bernstone, ein indischer Butler namens Lal Rao und der Pförtner namens McMurdo.\n",
      "Es ist gesicherte Erkenntnis, daß der Dieb oder die Diebe mit dem Haus vertraut waren.\n",
      "Mr. Jones' wohlbekanntes Fachwissen und die Fähigkeit zu genauester Beobachtung erbrachten den Beweis, daß die Eindringlinge nicht durch Tür oder Fenster kamen, sondern den Weg über das Dach des Gebäudes nahmen und über eine Falltür in einen Raum eindrangen, der mit dem Zimmer des Toten in Verbindung stand.\n",
      "Diese klar herausgearbeitete Tatsache beweist, das es kein willkürlicher Einbruch war.\n",
      "Die schnelle und energische Reaktion der Gesetzeshüter zeigt, wie vorteilhaft die Präsenz eines einzelnen dynamischen und meisterhaften Geistes in solch einem Falle ist.\n",
      "Dies ist wieder ein Beweis dafür, daß unsere Detektive dezentraler eingesetzt werden sollten, damit sie in näheren und effizienteren Kontakt mit den Fällen kommen, deren Aufklärung ihre Pflicht ist.«\n",
      "»Ist das nicht prächtig,« sagte Holmes und grinste über den Rand seiner Kaffeetasse. »Was halten Sie davon?«\n",
      "»Ich glaube, daß wir nur um Haaresbreite unserer eigenen Verhaftung entkommen sind.«\n",
      "»Das glaube ich auch.\n",
      "Ich würde nicht für unsere Sicherheit bürgen wollen, sollte er noch einen Anfall von Energie erleiden.«\n",
      "Im gleichen Moment klingelte es laut und ich hörte unsere Wirtin Mrs. Hudson, deren Stimme in einem Schwall von Protest und Bestürzung immer lauter wurde.\n",
      "»Um Himmelswillen, Holmes,« sagte ich halblaut, »ich glaube, sie sind wirklich hinter uns her.«\n",
      "»Nein, so schlimm steht es nicht.\n",
      "Es ist die inoffizielle Polizeitruppe der Baker Street.«\n",
      "Kaum hatte er das gesagt, war ein flinkes Fußgetrappel und ein Stimmengewirr die Treppe hinauf zu hören.\n",
      "Herein rauschte ein Dutzend schmutziger und zerlumpter Gassenjungen.\n",
      "Trotz des tumulthaften Hereinkommens zeigten sie eine gewisse Disziplin.\n",
      "Sie stellten sich augenblicklich in einer Reihe auf und schauten uns mit erwartungsvollen Gesichtern an.\n",
      "Ein etwas größerer und älterer unter ihnen trat mit einer selbstverständlichen Anmaßung der Führung vor, die bei einer derart unansehnlichen Schreckgestalt sehr komisch wirkte.\n",
      "»Hab' Ihre Nachricht erhalten, Sir,« sagte er, »und hab' sie schnell zusammengetrommelt.\n",
      "Drei Shillin' und 'nen Sixpence für die Karten.«\n",
      "»Hier sind sie,« sagte Holmes und zog ein paar Silbermünzen heraus. »Zukünftig können sie Dir berichten, Wiggins; und Du berichtest mir.\n",
      "So wie eben könnt ihr nicht immer bei mir hereinstürmen.\n",
      "Egal, dann hört ihr jetzt wenigstens zusammen meine Anweisungen.\n",
      "Ich suche den Verbleib einer Dampfbarkasse mit dem Namen Aurora, sie gehört Mordecai Smith, sie ist schwarz mit zwei roten Streifen, der Schornstein ist ebenfalls schwarz mit einem weißen Band.\n",
      "Sie ist irgendwo flußabwärts.\n",
      "Ich will einen Jungen bei Mordecais Steg gegenüber von Millbank, der uns meldet, wenn das Schiff zurückkommt.\n",
      "Teilt es euch selbst ein, aber untersucht beide Flußufer gründlich.\n",
      "Berichtet mir sofort jede Neuigkeit.\n",
      "Alles verstanden?«\n",
      "»Ja, Chef,« sagte Wiggins.\n",
      "»Bezahlung wie üblich, und eine Guinee extra an den, der das Schiff findet.\n",
      "Hier ist das Geld für den ersten Tag.\n",
      "Auf geht's!« Er gab jedem einen Shilling und sie schossen die Treppen hinunter.\n",
      "Im nächsten Moment sah ich sie auf der Straße verschwinden.\n",
      "»Wenn die Barkasse sich über Wasser befindet, wird sie auch entdeckt,« sagte Holmes, als er aufstand und sich die Pfeife anzündete. »Sie kommen überall hin, sehen alles und belauschen jeden.\n",
      "Ich erwarte, daß sie das Schiff noch vor dem Abend auffinden.\n",
      "Wir können bis dahin nur warten.\n",
      "Unsere Spur können wir erst dann wieder aufnehmen, wenn wir die Aurora oder Mr. Mordecai Smith gefunden haben.«\n",
      "»Toby könnte die Essensreste erhalten.\n",
      "Gehen Sie zu Bett, Mr. Holmes?«\n",
      "»Nein, ich bin nicht müde.\n",
      "Ich habe eine seltsame Konstitution.\n",
      "Solange ich arbeite, bin ich nie müde; aber Untätigkeit erschöpft mich total.\n",
      "Ich werde weiter rauchen und über diesen merkwürdigen Fall nachdenken, den uns unsere hübsche Kundin beschert hat.\n",
      "Es gibt kaum eine einfachere Arbeit als die, welche jetzt vor uns liegt.\n",
      "Leute mit Holzbein gibt es wenige, aber der andere Mann muß absolut einzigartig sein.«\n",
      "»Wieder dieser andere Mann!«\n",
      "»Ich will kein Geheimnis aus ihm machen.\n",
      "Aber Sie müssen sich eine eigene Meinung bilden.\n",
      "Betrachten Sie die Tatsachen.\n",
      "Kleine Fußabdrücke, Zehen nie in Schuhe gezwängt, nackte Füße, eine hölzerne Keule mit Steingriff, große Beweglichkeit, kleine vergiftete Pfeile.\n",
      "Wie entwirren Sie das?«\n",
      "»Ein Wilder!« rief ich aus. »Vielleicht einer dieser Inder, die bei Jonathan Small waren.«\n",
      "»Kaum,« sagte er. »Als ich anfangs die Anzeichen seltsamer Waffen bemerkte, dachte ich das Gleiche.\n",
      "Aber die außergewöhnliche Beschaffenheit der Fußabdrücke hat meine Meinung geändert.\n",
      "Einige Bewohner Indiens sind kleinwüchsig, aber keiner könnte solche Fußabdrücke hinterlassen.\n",
      "Der typische Inder hat lange, schmale Füße.\n",
      "Der Mohammedaner in Sandalen hat den großen Zeh von den anderen abgespreizt, da dort der Sandalriemen sitzt.\n",
      "Die kleinen Pfeile konnten nur auf eine Art abgefeuert werden, nämlich durch ein Blasrohr.\n",
      "Und woher kommt dann unser Wilder?«\n",
      "»Aus Südamerika,« wagte ich zu behaupten.\n",
      "Er griff nach einem dickleibigen Band aus dem Bücherregal.\n",
      "»Dies ist der gerade herausgekommene erste Band eines alphabetischen Ortsverzeichnisses mit Ortsbeschreibungen.\n",
      "Er enthält die aktuellsten Informationen.\n",
      "Was haben wir hier?\n",
      "›Inselgruppe der Andamanen, etwa 340 Meilen nördlich von Sumatra im Golf von Bengalen gelegen.\n",
      "‹ Hmm!\n",
      "Was noch?\n",
      "Feuchtes Klima, Korallenriff, Haie, Port Blair, Straflager, die Insel Rutland, Baumwolle – ah, hier haben wir es.\n",
      "›Die Eingeborenen der Andamanen gehören zur Rasse der kleinsten Menschen auf der Erde, obwohl einige Anthropologen dies über die Buschmänner Afrikas, die amerikanischen Digger-Indianer und die Feuerländer ebenfalls behaupten.\n",
      "Die mittlere Größe beträgt weniger als vier Fuß, aber man findet auch Erwachsene, die viel kleiner sind.\n",
      "Sie sind ein wildes, verstocktes und widerspenstiges Volk, zeigen aber hingebungsvolle Freunschaft, wenn sie einmal Vertrauen gewonnen haben.\n",
      "‹ Merken Sie sich das, Watson.\n",
      "Und hören Sie weiter.\n",
      "›Sie sind im allgemeinen von häßlichem Aussehen und haben große, mißgestaltete Köpfe, kleine wilde Augen und entstellte Gesichter.\n",
      "Die Arme und Beine sind außergewöhnlich klein.\n",
      "Sie sind so widerspenstig und wild, daß trotz vieler Versuche die britischen Kolonialbeamten ihr Vertrauen noch nicht gewinnen konnten.\n",
      "Sie waren schon immer der Schrecken aller schiffbrüchigen Besatzungen, da sie den Überlebenden mit ihren Steinäxten die Schädel einschlugen oder sie mit vergifteten Pfeilen beschossen.\n",
      "Diese Massaker gipfelten häufig in einem kannibalischen Fest.\n",
      "‹ Nette, liebenswürdige Menschen, Watson!\n",
      "Wenn dieser Kerl ohne Aufsicht gewesen wäre, hätte die Sache eine noch schlimmere Wendung nehmen können.\n",
      "Es scheint mir, daß Jonathan Small sich selber wünscht, ihn niemals beschäftigt zu haben.«\n",
      "»Aber wie kam er zu einem solch eigenartigen Begleiter?«\n",
      "»Das kann ich Ihnen noch nicht sagen.\n",
      "Da wir bereits wissen, daß Smith von den Andamanen kam, ist es nicht besonders verwunderlich, daß der Insulaner bei ihm ist.\n",
      "Zweifellos wissen wir bald mehr.\n",
      "Watson, Sie sehen ziemlich fertig aus.\n",
      "Legen Sie sich aufs Sofa, vielleicht kann ich Sie zum Einschlafen bringen.«\n",
      "Er nahm seine Violine aus der Ecke, ich streckte mich aus und er begann einige leise, verträumte und melodiöse Weisen zu spielen – eigene Kompositionen, denn er hatte ein bemerkenswertes Talent zur Improvisation.\n",
      "Ich erinnere mich schwach an seine hageren Glieder, sein ernstes Gesicht und das Auf und Ab seines Geigenbogens.\n",
      "Dann schien ich in einem weichen Meer aus Klängen davonzuschwimmen, bis ich mich in einem Traum befand, in dem das liebe Gesicht von Mary Morstan auf mich herabsah.\n",
      "Ein Bruch in der Kette\n",
      "Es war später Nachmittag, als ich erfrischt und gestärkt aufwachte.\n",
      "Holmes saß noch in der gleichen Stellung, in der ich ihn vor dem Einschlafen gesehen hatte.\n",
      "Er hatte nur seine Violine zur Seite gelegt und war in ein Buch vertieft.\n",
      "Als ich mich rührte, sah er kurz zu mir herüber und ich bemerkte, daß sein Ausdruck dunkel und verärgert war.\n",
      "»Sie haben fest geschlafen,« sagte er, »ich fürchtete schon, unsere Unterhaltung würde Sie aufwecken.«\n",
      "»Ich habe nichts gehört,« antwortete ich, »haben Sie denn Neuigkeiten erhalten?«\n",
      "»Leider nein.\n",
      "Ich gestehe, daß ich überrascht und enttäuscht bin.\n",
      "Es hätten schon Nachrichten eintreffen müssen.\n",
      "Wiggins hat mir soeben Bericht erstattet.\n",
      "Er sagt, daß von der Barkasse keine Spur gefunden werden konnte.\n",
      "Das ist ein ärgerlicher Rückschlag, denn jede Stunde ist kostbar.«\n",
      "»Kann ich etwas tun?\n",
      "Ich fühle mich vollkommen erfrischt und bin für eine weitere Nachtwanderung gerüstet.«\n",
      "»Nein, wir können nur warten.\n",
      "Gehen wir selbst, könnte die Nachricht während unserer Abwesenheit eintreffen und alles verzögern.\n",
      "Machen Sie, was Sie wollen, ich bleibe hier in Bereitschaft.«\n",
      "»Dann gehe ich hinüber nach Camberwell und besuche Mrs. Cecil Forrester.\n",
      "Sie bat mich gestern darum.«\n",
      "»Zu Mrs. Cecil Forrester?« fragte er mit einem Anflug von Lächeln in den Augen.\n",
      "»Ja, natürlich auch zu Miss Morstan.\n",
      "Beide sind bestimmt neugierig, das bisher Geschehene zu erfahren.\n",
      "»Ich würde ihnen nicht allzuviel erzählen,« sagte Holmes. »Frauen kann man nie ganz trauen – nicht einmal den besten.«\n",
      "Ich vermied einen Streit über diese scheußliche Meinung.\n",
      "»Ich bin in einer oder zwei Stunden zurück,« bemerkte ich.\n",
      "»Gut!\n",
      "Viel Glück!\n",
      "Wenn Sie aber schon über den Fluß müssen, könnten Sie auch Toby zurückbringen.\n",
      "Ich glaube nicht, daß wir noch Verwendung für ihn finden werden.«\n",
      "So nahm ich unsere Promenadenmischung und brachte ihn mit einem 10-Shilling-Stück für den Botaniker in die Pinch-Street.\n",
      "In Camberwell war Mrs. Morstan ein wenig müde nach den nächtlichen Abenteuern, aber dennoch lebhaft erregt, die Neuigkeiten zu erfahren.\n",
      "Auch Mrs. Forrester war neugierig.\n",
      "Ich erzählte ihnen alles, was wir bisher unternommen hatten, vermied aber die schlimmeren Teile unserer Tragödie.\n",
      "Ich sprach wohl über den Tod von Mr. Sholto, sagte aber nichts über die Umstände und die genaue Todesart.\n",
      "Doch trotz meiner Auslassungen gab es genug Erstaunen und Erschrecken.\n",
      "»Fantastisch!« rief Mrs. Forrester. »Eine um eine halbe Million betrogene Lady, ein schwarzer Kannibale und ein Schurke mit Holzbein.\n",
      "Anstelle des üblichen Drachens und des bösen Barons.«\n",
      "»Und zwei Ritter eilen zu ihrer Rettung,« fügte Miss Morstan mit einem an mich gerichteten strahlenden Lächeln hinzu.\n",
      "»Nun, Mary, Ihr zukünftiges Vermögen hängt von den Ergebnissen dieser Suche ab.\n",
      "Sie können nicht aufgeregt genug sein.\n",
      "Denken Sie daran, wie reich Sie sein werden und wie dann die Welt zu Ihren Füßen liegt!«\n",
      "Ein Freudenschimmer bemächtigte sich meiner, als ich bemerkte, daß diese Aussicht ihr Verhalten nicht änderte.\n",
      "Im Gegenteil, sie warf den Kopf stolz zurück, als ob sie an der Sache keinen Anteil nähme.\n",
      "»Ich bin um Mr. Thaddeus Sholto besorgt,« sagte sie. »Alles andere ist bedeutungslos.\n",
      "Ich denke, er hat sich sehr ehrenwert und nett gezeigt.\n",
      "Wir sollten ihn von dieser fürchterlichen und unbegründeten Anklage befreien.«\n",
      "Als ich Camberwell verließ, war es Abend geworden und schon sehr dunkel, als ich zu Hause ankam.\n",
      "Buch und Pfeife meines Begleiters lagen auf seinem Stuhl, er aber war verschwunden.\n",
      "Trotz Suche nach einer Notiz fand ich nichts.\n",
      "Als Mrs. Hudson kam, um die Jalousien herunterzulassen, sagte ich: »Holmes ist sicherlich spazierengegangen.«\n",
      "»Nein, Sir.\n",
      "Er ist auf sein Zimmer gegangen.\n",
      "Wissen Sie, daß ich mir über seine Gesundheit Sorgen mache?« antwortete sie mit leiser Stimme.\n",
      "»Und warum, Mrs. Hudson?«\n",
      "»Nun, er benimmt sich so merkwürdig, Sir.\n",
      "Nachdem Sie gegangen waren, ist er auf und ab gegangen, immer wieder auf und ab, bis ich dem Geräusch seiner Fußtritte überdrüssig wurde.\n",
      "Dann sprach und murmelte er zu sich, und jedesmal, wenn die Klingel ging, rief er: »Was ist, Mrs. Hudson?« Und jetzt hat er sein Zimmer verriegelt, aber ich höre ihn immer noch herumgehen.\n",
      "Ich hoffe, er wird nicht krank, Sir.\n",
      "Ich sagte ihm etwas über lindernde Medizin, aber er sah mich derart an, daß ich nicht einmal weiß, wie ich aus dem Zimmer kam.«\n",
      "»Es gibt keinen Grund zur Beunruhigung, Mrs. Hudson,« antwortete ich. »So habe ich ihn schon früher gesehen.\n",
      "Er hat ein kleines Problem, und das macht ihn ruhelos.« Ich versuchte, beruhigend auf unsere Wirtin einzureden, war aber dennoch selbst etwas beunruhigt, als ich die ganze Nacht den dumpfen Klang seiner Schritte hörte.\n",
      "Ich wußte, daß sein scharfer Verstand gegen die ungewollte Passivität rebellierte.\n",
      "Zum Frühstück sah er erschöpft und ausgezehrt aus und hatte kleine fiebrige Flecken auf beiden Wangen.\n",
      "»Sie reiben sich selbst auf, mein Herr,« bemerkte ich. »Ich habe Sie die ganze Nacht wandern gehört.«\n",
      "»Nun, ich konnte nicht schlafen,« antwortete er. »Dieses höllische Problem frißt mich auf.\n",
      "Wo schon fast alles geklärt ist, darf uns solch kleines Hindernis nicht aufhalten.\n",
      "Ich kenne die Leute, das Schiff, fast alles – und doch kommen keine neuen Nachrichten.\n",
      "Ich habe noch andere Nachrichtenquellen angezapft und jedes mir zur Verfügung stehende Mittel angewandt.\n",
      "Der Fluß ist auf beiden Seiten gründlich durchsucht worden, trotzdem gibt es keine Neuigkeiten und Mrs. Smith hat nichts von ihrem Mann gehört.\n",
      "Fast kommt mir der Gedanke, daß sie das Schiff versenkt haben.\n",
      "Aber dagegen spricht etwas anderes.«\n",
      "»Oder Mrs. Smith hat uns auf eine falsche Fährte gelockt.«\n",
      "»Nein, das können wir vergessen.\n",
      "Ich habe Nachforschungen angestellt, es gibt eine Barkasse mit genau dieser Beschreibung.«\n",
      "»Könnten sie flußaufwärts gefahren sein?«\n",
      "»Auch das habe ich in Betracht gezogen.\n",
      "Es ist ein Suchtrupp bis hoch nach Richmond unterwegs.\n",
      "Wenn heute keine Nachrichten kommen, werde ich morgen aufbrechen und nach den Männern anstatt nach dem Boot suchen.\n",
      "Aber wir werden bestimmt etwas hören.«\n",
      "Wir hörten nichts.\n",
      "Weder Wiggins noch andere Quellen brachten neue Informationen.\n",
      "In allen Zeitungen wurden Artikel über die Norwood-Tragödie veröffentlicht.\n",
      "Und alles sprach gegen den unglücklichen Thaddeus Sholto.\n",
      "Es gab keine neuen Fakten, aber die gerichtliche Untersuchung der Todesursache wurde für den folgenden Tag angekündigt.\n",
      "Ich fuhr am Abend nach Camberwell um den Damen unsere Mißerfolge zu berichten.\n",
      "Bei meiner Rückkehr fand ich Holmes niedergeschlagen und etwas verschlossen.\n",
      "Er beantwortete meine Fragen kaum und beschäftigte sich den ganzen Abend mit einer abstrusen chemischen Analyse.\n",
      "Er erhitzte Retortengläser und destillierte Dämpfe, deren Geruch mich letztendlich aus dem Zimmer vertrieben.\n",
      "Bis in die frühen Morgenstunden konnte ich das Klirren seiner Teströhrchen hören und ich war sicher, daß er immer noch an seinen übelriechenden Experimenten arbeitete.\n",
      "Zur Morgendämmerung wachte ich auf und war überrascht, als er plötzlich neben meinem Bett stand.\n",
      "Er trug grobe Seemanskleidung mit Rollkragen und einen roten Schal um den Hals.\n",
      "»Ich gehe jetzt zum Fluß, Watson,« sagte er. »Nach allen Überlegungen sehe ich nur einen einzigen Weg.\n",
      "Und den werde ich auf jeden Fall versuchen.«\n",
      "»Ich darf doch sicherlich mitkommen?« fragte ich.\n",
      "»Nein.\n",
      "Sie sind hier besser als mein Vertreter aufgehoben.\n",
      "Ich gehe ungern, denn es sieht so aus, daß heute noch wichtige Nachrichten eintreffen werden.\n",
      "Obgleich Wiggins gestern nacht noch nicht sicher war.\n",
      "Bitte öffnen Sie alle Nachrichten und Telegramme und handeln Sie dann nach Ihrem eigenen Ermessen.\n",
      "Kann ich mich auf Sie verlassen?«\n",
      "»Aber sicher.«\n",
      "»Sie werden mich nicht benachrichtigen können, denn ich kann Ihnen nicht sagen, wo ich mich befinden werde.\n",
      "Mit viel Glück bin ich aber nicht sehr lange fort.\n",
      "Und ich werde mit Nachrichten der einen oder der anderen Art zurückkommen.«\n",
      "Bis zum Frühstück hörte ich nichts von ihm.\n",
      "Als ich den Standard aufschlug, fand ich eine frische Anspielung auf unser Unternehmen.\n",
      "»Zur Norwood-Tragödie,« berichtete man, »wird angenommen, daß der Fall doch komplexer und mysteriöser ist als ursprünglich angenommen wurde.\n",
      "Neuere Hinweise haben ergeben, daß Mr. Thaddeus Sholto unmöglich mit dem Mordfall in Verbindung gebracht werden kann.\n",
      "Er und seine Haushälterin Mrs. Bernstone wurden gestern auf freien Fuß gesetzt.\n",
      "Es wird aber vermutet, daß die Polizei einen Hinweis auf die wahren Täter hat.\n",
      "Mr. Athelney Jones von Scotland Yard verfolgt die Spuren mit bekannter Energie und Scharfsinn.\n",
      "Weitere Verhaftungen werden in Kürze erwartet.«\n",
      "»Soweit ist es gut,« dachte ich. »Unser Freund Sholto ist jedenfalls gerettet.\n",
      "Was mag die neue Spur sein, von der berichtet wird?\n",
      "Aber das ist sicher eine der Floskeln, die bei der Polizei im Fall von Pannen benutzt wird.«\n",
      "Ich warf die Zeitung auf den Tisch und im gleichen Moment fiel mein Auge auf eine Anzeige in der Rubrik »Verschiedenes«.\n",
      "Dort stand:\n",
      "»Vermißt – Mordecai Smith, Seemann, und sein Sohn Jim.\n",
      "Verließen Smiths Werft Dienstag gegen drei Uhr mit der Dampfbarkasse Aurora, schwarz mit zwei roten Streifen, Schornstein schwarz mit weißem Band.\n",
      "Fünf Pfund Belohnung für Informationen über Verbleib von genanntem Mordecai Smith oder der Barkasse Aurora.\n",
      "Nachrichtigen bitte an Mrs. Smith, Smith's Werft, oder an 221b Baker Street.«\n",
      "Das war eindeutig Holmes Werk.\n",
      "Das sah man schon an der Adresse »Baker Street«.\n",
      "Ich fand es sehr einfallsreich, da es von den Flüchtigen gelesen werden konnte und dennoch nur auf die natürliche Sorge einer Frau um ihren vermißten Ehemann hinwies.\n",
      "Ein langer Tag begann.\n",
      "Jedesmal, wenn es an der Tür klopfte oder eilige Schritte auf der Straße zu hören waren, erwartete ich Holmes oder eine Nachricht auf die Anzeige.\n",
      "Ich versuchte zu lesen, aber meine Gedanken wanderten sofort zu unserer Suche nach dem Schurkenpaar, das wir verfolgten.\n",
      "Könnte es einen Fehler in der Gedankenkette meines Begleiters geben?\n",
      "Könnte er einem Trugbild hinterherlaufen?\n",
      "Könnte nicht sein schneller und theoretisierender Verstand eine These aufgestellt haben, die auf falschen Voraussetzungen beruhte?\n",
      "Ich hatte noch nie erlebt, daß er sich geirrt hatte, aber auch der schärfste Verstand täuscht sich gelegentlich.\n",
      "Durch die Überschätzung seiner Logik könnte er einem Fehlschluß aufgesessen sein und eine spitzfindige und feinsinnige Erklärung gewählt haben, wo eine einfache und triviale Lösung auf der Hand lag.\n",
      "Andererseits hatte ich die Beweise gesehen und war mit seinen Folgerungen einverstanden.\n",
      "Im Rückblick auf die lange Kette von Ereignissen sahen viele trivial aus, aber sie führten alle in die gleiche Richtung.\n",
      "Ich konnte nicht verhehlen, daß die Wahrheit erschreckend sein könnte, selbst wenn Holmes' Erklärungen falsch gewesen sein sollten.\n",
      "Nachmittags um drei Uhr läutete es an der Haustür, ich hörte eine gebieterische Stimme im Hausflur und Mr. Athelney Jones wurde zu mir geführt.\n",
      "Er ähnelte nicht mehr der brüsken und gebieterischen Person, die den Fall in Upper Norwood übernommen hatte.\n",
      "Er war niedergeschlagen, sanftmütig, ja fast entschuldigend.\n",
      "»Guten Tag, Sir, guten Tag,« sagte er, »wie ich sehe, ist Mr. Holmes unterwegs.«\n",
      "»Ja, und ich kann nicht sagen, wann er zurückkommt.\n",
      "Aber vielleicht möchten Sie warten.\n",
      "Setzen Sie sich und nehmen Sie eine dieser Zigarren.«\n",
      "»Danke, ich nehme mir die Freiheit,« sagte er und wischte sich das Gesicht mit einem roten Taschentuch.\n",
      "»Möchten Sie einen Whiskey-Soda?«\n",
      "»Gern, ein halbes Glas.\n",
      "Für diese Jahreszeit ist es sehr warm und ich habe reichlich Sorgen.\n",
      "Kennen Sie meine Theorie über den Norwood-Fall?«\n",
      "»Ja, Sie hatten eine Theorie.«\n",
      "»Nun, ich muß sie neu überdenken.\n",
      "Ich hatte mein Netz fest um Mr. Sholto gezogen, als er es mit einem Knall durch ein Loch in der Mitte verließ.\n",
      "Er konnte ein Alibi vorweisen, das nicht zu erschüttern war.\n",
      "Seit er das Zimmer seines Bruders verließ, war er immer von anderen Personen gesehen worden.\n",
      "Er konnte daher nicht derjenige sein, der das Dach erklomm und durch die Falltür hereinkam.\n",
      "Ein sehr dunkler Fall und meine Glaubwürdigkeit steht auf dem Spiel.\n",
      "Ich würde mich über jede Hilfe freuen.«\n",
      "»Wir alle brauchen manchmal Hilfe,« sagte ich.\n",
      "»Ihr Freund Sherlock Holmes ist ein bemerkenswerter Mann, Sir,« sagte er mit heiserer und vertraulicher Stimme. »Er ist unermüdlich.\n",
      "Ich habe ihn schon eine Menge Fälle bearbeiten gesehen, und noch in jeden Fall hat er bisher Licht gebracht.\n",
      "So ungewöhnlich seine Methoden auch sind, und wie schnell er sich auch auf Theorien versteift, letztendlich hätte er einen guten Polizeioffizier abgegeben.\n",
      "Heute morgen erhielt ich von ihm ein Telegramm, dem ich entnahm, daß er neue Anhaltspunkte zum Sholto-Fall gefunden hat.\n",
      "Hier ist die Nachricht.«\n",
      "Er nahm das Telegramm aus der Tasche und gab es mir.\n",
      "Es war um zwölf Uhr in Poplar aufgegeben.\n",
      "»Gehen Sie sofort zur Baker Street.\n",
      "Falls ich nicht dort bin, warten Sie.\n",
      "Ich bin der Sholto Gang auf den Fersen.\n",
      "Wenn Sie am Finale teilnehmen wollen, begleiten Sie uns heute Nacht.«\n",
      "»Das klingt gut.\n",
      "Er hat anscheinend die Fährte wieder aufgenommen,« sagte ich.\n",
      "»Oh, dann hatte auch er sich getäuscht,« eiferte er mit sichtlicher Befriedigung. »Auch die Besten täuschen sich manchmal.\n",
      "Natürlich kann es ein falscher Alarm sein, aber meine Pflicht als Polizist verlangt, daß ich keine Gelegenheit verpasse.\n",
      "Doch da klopft jemand an der Tür.\n",
      "Vielleicht ist er es.«\n",
      "Wir hörten schwere Schritte heraufkommen, der pfeifende und röchelnde Klang war ein Anzeichen von Atemnot.\n",
      "Der Ankömmling stoppte mehrfach, als wäre der Aufstieg zu beschwerlich für ihn; doch schließlich betrat er unser Zimmer.\n",
      "Sein Aussehen entsprach den von uns gehörten Geräuschen.\n",
      "Es war ein älterer Mann in Seemannskleidung und hochgeschlossenem Rollkragenpullover.\n",
      "Er hatte einem gebeugten Rücken, wacklige Knie und offensichtlich asthmatische Beschwerden.\n",
      "Auf einen dicken eichernen Stock gestützt, zeigte das Heben seiner Schultern die Anstrengung, genügend Luft in seine Lungen zu bekommen.\n",
      "Um den Hals trug er einen farbigen Schal, vom Gesicht sah man nur die grauen Schnurrbarthaare und ein Paar scharfe dunkle Augen, die von buschigen Augenbrauen bedeckt wurden.\n",
      "Er machte auf mich den Eindruck eines ehrbaren Seemanns, mit deutlichen Anzeichen von Alter und Armut.\n",
      "»Worum geht es?« fragte ich.\n",
      "Er schaute mit der Bedächtigkeit des Alters herum.\n",
      "»Ist Mr. Sherlock Holmes hier?« fragte er.\n",
      "»Nein.\n",
      "Aber ich vertrete ihn.\n",
      "Sie können mir jede Mitteilung an ihn übermitteln.«\n",
      "»Ich will nur mit ihm reden,« sagte er.\n",
      "»Ich sagte bereits, ich vertrete ihn.\n",
      "Geht es um Mordecai Smith's Schiff?«\n",
      "»Ja, ich weiß, wo es ist.\n",
      "Und weiß auch, wo die Männer sind, hinter denen er her ist.\n",
      "Und weiß, wo der Schatz ist.\n",
      "Weiß alles darüber.«\n",
      "»Dann reden Sie, und ich erzähle es ihm.«\n",
      "»Ich erzähl' es nur ihm,« sagte er mit der Hartnäckigkeit eines gereizten alten Mannes.\n",
      "»Gut, dann müssen Sie auf ihn warten.«\n",
      "»Nein, nein; ich bleib' hier keinen ganzen Tag, nur aus Gefälligkeit.\n",
      "Wenn Mr. Holmes nicht da ist, muß er es eben selbst herausfinden.\n",
      "Eure Gesichter gefallen mir nicht und ich sage kein Wort.«\n",
      "Er schlurfte zur Tür, aber Athelney Jones stellte sich vor ihm auf.\n",
      "»Momentchen, mein Freund,« sagte er. »Sie haben wichtige Informationen und Sie können nicht einfach fortgehen.\n",
      "Wir behalten Sie hier bis unser Freund zurück ist, ob Sie wollen oder nicht.«\n",
      "Der alte Mann versuchte, durch die Tür zu entkommen, aber er erkannte die Zwecklosigkeit des Versuchs, weil Athelney Jones seine breiten Schultern in der Tür plazierte.\n",
      "»Das ist 'ne schöne Behandlung!« rief er und stampfte mit dem Stock auf. »Ich kam, um einen Gentleman zu sehen, und Sie beide behandeln mich in einer derartigen Weise!«\n",
      "»Es hätte Schlimmeres passieren können,« sagte ich. »Wir werden Sie für die Wartezeit entschädigen.\n",
      "Setzen Sie sich hier auf das Sofa.\n",
      "Sie werden nicht lange warten müssen.«\n",
      "Er kam mürrisch herüber und setzte sich, den Kopf in die Hände gestützt.\n",
      "Jones und ich nahmen die Unterhaltung wieder auf, bis uns kurze Zeit später die Stimme von Holmes unterbrach.\n",
      "»Sie könnten mir ruhig auch eine Zigarre anbieten,« sagte er.\n",
      "Beide sprangen wir aus unseren Stühlen.\n",
      "Holmes saß plötzlich auf dem Sofa und schaute uns amüsiert an.\n",
      "»Wieso sind Sie plötzlich hier!« rief ich aus, »und wo ist der alte Mann?«\n",
      "»Hier ist er,« sagte er und zeigte ein Büschel weißer Haare. »Hier ist er, mit Perücke, Schnurrbart, Augenbrauen und allem anderen.\n",
      "Ich wußte, meine Verkleidung war recht gut, aber daß sie den Test besteht, hätte ich nicht gedacht.«\n",
      "»Oh, Sie Gauner!« rief Jones begeistert, »Sie würden einen guten Schauspieler abgeben, und zwar einen, wie man ihn selten findet.\n",
      "Sie hatten den typischen Husten eines Zwangsarbeiters aus dem Armenhaus und Ihre schwachen Beine würden nur zehn Pfund die Woche bringen.\n",
      "Aber beinahe hätte ich Sie am Glanz Ihrer Augen erkannt.\n",
      "Sie wären uns nicht so leicht entkommen.«\n",
      "»Ich habe heute den ganzen Tag in dieser Aufmachung gearbeitet«, sagte er und zündete sich die Zigarre an. »Viele Leute aus dem kriminellen Lager kennen mich bereits – seit unser Freund hier einige meiner Fälle veröffentlicht hat.\n",
      "So kann ich mich nur noch in Verkleidung auf den Kriegspfad begeben.\n",
      "Haben Sie mein Telegramm erhalten?«\n",
      "»Ja, deshalb bin ich hier.«\n",
      "»Und wie ist Ihr Fall gediehen?«\n",
      "»Fast wieder bei Null angekommen.\n",
      "Ich mußte zwei der Festgenommenen freilassen und bei den anderen beiden gibt es nicht genügend Beweise.«\n",
      "»Kein Problem, wir geben Ihnen statt dessen zwei neue.\n",
      "Aber Sie müssen sich meinen Befehlen beugen.\n",
      "Die öffentliche Belobigung dürfen Sie einheimsen, aber Sie müssen meinen Richtlinien entsprechend mitarbeiten.\n",
      "Sind Sie damit einverstanden?«\n",
      "»Uneingeschränkt, wenn ich die Leute damit erwische.«\n",
      "»Gut, dann brauche ich erst einmal ein schnelles Polizeiboot, das um sieben Uhr bei Westminster bereitsteht.«\n",
      "»Das kann ich schnell erledigen.\n",
      "In der Nähe liegt ein Boot; ich werde kurz telefonieren und das arrangieren.«\n",
      "»Dann brauche ich zwei zuverlässige Männer, falls es Widerstand gibt.«\n",
      "»Zwei oder drei befinden sich auf dem Boot.\n",
      "Was brauchen Sie noch?«\n",
      "»Wenn wir die Männer festgenommen haben, werden wir den Schatz haben.\n",
      "Ich glaube, mein Freund hier wird es sich nicht nehmen lassen, ihn der jungen Dame geben zu wollen, der rechtmäßig die Hälfte gehört.\n",
      "Sie soll die erste sein, die die Schatzkiste öffnet – einverstanden, Watson?«\n",
      "»Es wäre mir ein Vergnügen.«\n",
      "»Eine recht ungewöhnliche Reihenfolge,« sagte Jones. »Aber die ganze Sache ist ungewöhnlich.\n",
      "Und wir müssen dabei ein Auge zudrücken.\n",
      "Aber danach muß der Schatz den Behörden übergeben werden, bis die offizielle Untersuchung abgeschlossen ist.«\n",
      "»Sicher.\n",
      "Das wird erfolgen.\n",
      "Noch ein weiterer Punkt.\n",
      "Einige Einzelheiten muß mir Jonathan Small noch selbst erzählen.\n",
      "Denn ich möchte alle Einzelheiten meiner Fälle geklärt wissen.\n",
      "Erklären Sie sich mit einem inoffiziellen Interview einverstanden, wenn es hier oder anderswo unter strenger Bewachung erfolgt?«\n",
      "»Ja, denn Sie haben jetzt das Sagen.\n",
      "Ich hatte bisher noch keinen Beweis für die Existenz dieses Jonathan Small.\n",
      "Wenn Sie ihn aber fangen, kann ich Ihnen das Interview wohl kaum verwehren.«\n",
      "»Dann haben wir uns verstanden?«\n",
      "»Vollkommen, gibt es sonst noch etwas?«\n",
      "»Nein, aber ich bestehe darauf, daß Sie mit uns speisen.\n",
      "Das Essen wird in einer halben Stunde serviert.\n",
      "Es gibt Austern und zwei Moorhühner, dazu Weißwein nach Ihrer Wahl.\n",
      "Watson, haben Sie eigentlich schon gemerkt, welch guter Gastgeber ich bin?«\n",
      "Das Ende des Insulaners\n",
      "Wir hatten eine ausgezeichnete Mahlzeit.\n",
      "Wenn Holmes wollte, konnte er sehr unterhaltsam sein; und heute wollte er.\n",
      "Er befand sich in einem Zustand nervöser Erregung.\n",
      "Selten hatte ich ihn so brillant erlebt.\n",
      "In munterer Reihenfolge sprach er über eine Reihe von Themen – über Wundererscheinungen, mittelalterliche Töpferkunst, die Stradivari-Violine, den ceylonesischen Buddhismus und über Kriegsschiffe der Zukunft.\n",
      "Jedes Thema behandelte er so, als hätte er darüber spezielle Studien angestellt.\n",
      "Seine humorvolle Darstellung stand in deutlichem Kontrast zu den dunklen Depressionen der vergangenen Tage.\n",
      "Athelney Jones erwies sich bei inoffiziellen Treffen als geselliger Typ und genoß das Dinner.\n",
      "Ich selbst verspürte Begeisterung darüber, daß wir uns dem Ende des Abenteuers näherten und fing etwas von Holmes' Fröhlichkeit ein.\n",
      "Keiner von uns sprach während des Essens über die Umstände, die uns zu diesem zusammengeführt hatten.\n",
      "Als die Speisen abgeräumt wurden, schaute Holmes auf die Uhr und füllte drei Gläser mit Portwein.\n",
      "»Einen Schluck auf den Erfolg unserer Expedition,« sagte er, »Und nun müssen wir uns beeilen.\n",
      "Watson, haben Sie eine Pistole dabei?«\n",
      "»Mein Dienstrevolver ist im Schreibtisch.«\n",
      "»Dann nehmen Sie ihn bitte.\n",
      "Wir müssen gewappnet sein.\n",
      "Die Droschke steht bereits vor der Tür.\n",
      "Ich habe sie für halb sieben bestellt.«\n",
      "Es war kurz nach sieben Uhr als wir die Kaianlage von Westminster erreichten.\n",
      "Unser Boot war bereits dort.\n",
      "Holmes beäugte es kritisch.\n",
      "»Kann man es als Polizeiboot erkennen?«\n",
      "»Ja, am grünen Seitenlicht.«\n",
      "»Dann nehmen Sie es weg.«\n",
      "Diese kleine Veränderung wurde vorgenommen und wir gingen an Bord.\n",
      "Die Leinen wurden losgeworfen; ich setzte mich ins Heck.\n",
      "Ein Mann stand am Ruder, einer kümmerte sich um die Maschine, zwei stämmige Inspektoren saßen im Bugbereich.\n",
      "»Wohin?« fragte Jones.\n",
      "»Zum Tower.\n",
      "Sagen Sie ihnen, daß wir auf der anderen Seite vom Jacobson Yard anhalten werden.«\n",
      "Wir hatten offensichtlich ein sehr schnelles Schiff.\n",
      "Wir schossen an der langen Kette beladener Kähne vorbei, als würden sie sich nicht durch das Wasser bewegen.\n",
      "Holmes lächelte zufrieden, als wir ein Dampfschiff überholten und hinter uns ließen.\n",
      "»So können wir jeden auf dem Fluß erwischen,« sagte er.\n",
      "»Nicht alle, aber nur wenige Dampfschiffe können uns schlagen.«\n",
      "»Wir müssen die Aurora fangen, obwohl sie ein sehr schnelles Schiff ist.\n",
      "Ich sage Ihnen, wie sie aussieht, Watson.\n",
      "Erinnern Sie sich, wie ärgerlich ich über eine nichtige Sache wurde?«\n",
      "»Ja«\n",
      "»Nun, ich habe meinen Verstand durch eine chemische Analyse beruhigt.\n",
      "Einer unserer größten Staatsmänner hat gesagt, daß eine Veränderung der Arbeitsweise die beste Beruhigung ist.\n",
      "Das stimmt.\n",
      "Als ich die Kohlenwasserstoffe erfolgreich auflöste, kam ich zu unserem Sholto-Problem zurück und überdachte alles noch einmal.\n",
      "Die Jungen haben ohne Erfolg flußauf und flußab gesucht.\n",
      "Die Barkasse war an keinem Landeplatz, an keinem Kai und ist auch nicht zurückgekehrt.\n",
      "Und konnte auch nicht versenkt worden sein, um ihre Spuren zu verbergen – obwohl dies als mögliche Hypothese bleibt, wenn alles andere sich als falsch erweist.\n",
      "Small hat eine gewisse Art von Schläue, besitzt aber keine Veranlagung zu größerer Raffiniertheit.\n",
      "Dazu gehört normalerweise eine andere Ausbildung.\n",
      "Dann fiel mir auf, daß er schon länger in London gewesen sein mußte – da wir wissen, daß er Pondicherry Lodge längere Zeit beobachtete – und daß er mindestens einen Tag benötigte, um alles zu arrangieren.\n",
      "»Diese Argumentation erscheint mir ein wenig schwach,« sagte ich. »Hätte er nicht alles arrangieren können, bevor er aufbrach?«\n",
      "»Ich glaube nicht.\n",
      "Das Versteck wird er solange behalten, bis er weiß, daß er ohne das Versteck sein Ziel erreichen kann.\n",
      "Aber mir ist noch eine andere Sache aufgefallen.\n",
      "Jonathan Small muß erkannt haben, daß das ungewöhnliche Aussehen seines Begleiters trotz aller Verkleidung zu Gerüchten führen könnte, die mit dem Norwood Fall in Verbindung gebracht werden könnten.\n",
      "So scharfsichtig war er schon.\n",
      "Von ihrem Versteck aus sind sie in der Dunkelheit aufgebrochen und wollten vor Tageslicht zurück sein.\n",
      "Als sie bei der Barkasse ankamen, war es nach Aussage von Mrs. Smith bereits drei Uhr vorbei.\n",
      "Innerhalb einer Stunde wäre es hell und Leute kämen vorüber.\n",
      "Also nehme ich an, daß sie nicht weit kamen.\n",
      "Sie bezahlten Smith für sein Schweigen, reservierten sich die Barkasse für die spätere Flucht und verschwanden in ihrem Versteck mit dem Schatz.\n",
      "Während der nächsten paar Tage konnten sie die Nachrichten in den Zeitungen verfolgen und falls der Verdacht auf sie fiele, sich im Schutze der Nacht ihr Schiff in Gravesend oder in den Downs suchen, für das sie zweifellos schon eine Überfahrt nach Amerika oder in die Kolonien arrangiert hatten.«\n",
      "»Aber sie konnten die Barkasse doch nicht mit in ihr Versteck nehmen.«\n",
      "»So ist es.\n",
      "Ich vermutete das Schiff trotzt seiner Unsichtbarkeit ganz in dessen Nähe.\n",
      "Ich habe versucht, mich in Small hineinzuversetzen und es mit seinen Augen zu betrachten.\n",
      "Er hatte die Rückführung der Barkasse oder ihre Unterbringung an einem Kai verworfen, da ihre Entdeckung die Polizei leicht auf seine Spur führen könnte.\n",
      "Wie also konnte er das Schiff gleichzeitig verstecken und dennoch sofort zur Hand haben?\n",
      "Ich überlegte, was ich an seiner Stelle getan hätte; und ich konnte mir nur einen Weg vorstellen.\n",
      "Ich müßte sie zu einer Werft oder einem Reparaturbetrieb bringen und dort nur unwesentliche Reparaturen ausführen lassen.\n",
      "Die Barkasse wäre dann im Bootsschuppen oder Dock und damit gut verborgen.\n",
      "Doch gleichzeitig wäre sie in wenigen Stunden wieder betriebsbereit.«\n",
      "»Das ist eine einleuchtende Erklärung.«\n",
      "»Aber genau solche einfachen Sachen werden leicht übersehen.\n",
      "Ich beschloß, diese Idee weiter zu verfolgen.\n",
      "So begann ich in dieser Seemannskleidung alle Werften flußab zu befragen.\n",
      "Bis zur fünfzehnten waren es nur Fehlanzeigen, aber bei Jacobsen erfuhr ich, daß die Aurora ihnen von einem Mann mit Holzbein vor zwei Tagen überlassen worden war.\n",
      "Es sollten nur kleine Reparaturen am Ruder ausgeführt werden.\n",
      "›Es war aber nichts am Ruder,‹ sagte mir der Vorarbeiter.\n",
      "›Dort liegt sie, die mit den roten Streifen.\n",
      "‹ Und im gleichen Moment kam Mordecai Smith, der vermißte Besitzer.\n",
      "Er war stark angetrunken.\n",
      "Ich hatte ihn vorher zwar nie gesehen, aber er rief seinen Namen und den des Schiffes.\n",
      "›Ich brauche sie heute abend um acht Uhr, und zwar pünktlich, denn ich habe zwei Gentlemen, die nicht warten mögen.\n",
      "‹ Man hatte ihn augenscheinlich gut bezahlt, denn er warf den Männern einige Shillinge zu.\n",
      "Ich folgte ihm in einiger Entfernung.\n",
      "Als er in einer Kneipe einkehrte, ging ich zur Werft zurück.\n",
      "Unterwegs traf ich auf einen Jungen meiner Gang und stellte ihn als Wache bei der Barkasse ab.\n",
      "Er steht dicht am Wasser und wird mit seinem Taschentuch winken, wenn sie ablegen.\n",
      "Wir werden mitten im Fluß liegen und es wäre schon sehr seltsam, wenn wir nicht die Männer und den Schatz fangen würden.«\n",
      "»Sie haben alles sehr gewissenhaft geplant, egal ob es die richtigen oder die falschen Männer sind,« sagte Jones. »Aber wenn ich für den Fall verantwortlich wäre, hätte ich ein paar Polizisten auf Jacobson's Werft plaziert und sie sofort beim Erscheinen verhaftet.«\n",
      "»Dann wären sie wohl nicht erschienen.\n",
      "Dieser Small ist ein schlauer Bursche.\n",
      "Er würde einen Späher vorausschicken und wenn ihm etwas verdächtig wäre, würde er gemütlich eine weitere Woche abwarten.«\n",
      "»Aber wenn Sie bei Mordecai Smith geblieben wären, hätte dieser Sie zum Versteck führen können,« sagte ich.\n",
      "»Dann hätte ich den ganzen Tag verschwendet.\n",
      "Ich wette hundert zu eins, daß er nicht weiß, wo sie sich aufhalten.\n",
      "Solange er Schnaps und Geld hat, wird er keine Fragen stellen.\n",
      "Sie benachrichtigen ihn, was er zu tun hat.\n",
      "Ich habe alle Möglichkeiten in Erwägung gezogen und diese ist am wahrscheinlichsten.«\n",
      "Während unserer Unterhaltung waren wir unter einer Reihe von Themsebrücken hindurchgeschossen.\n",
      "Als wir am Stadtzentrum vorbeikamen, schmückten die letzten Strahlen der Sonne das Kreuz auf der Kuppel der St. Paul's Kathedrale.\n",
      "Es war Dämmerung, bevor wir den Tower erreichten.\n",
      "»Dort ist Jacobson's Werft,« sagte Holmes und zeigte auf eine Ansammlung von Masten und Takelage auf der Surrey-Seite des Flusses. »Fahren sie langsam im Schutz dieser Reihe von Lichtern hin und her.« Er nahm ein Nachtsichtglas aus seiner Tasche und starrte einige Zeit ans Ufer. »Meine Wache steht auf ihrem Posten,« bemerkte er, »aber kein Zeichen eines Taschentuchs.«\n",
      "»Wie wäre es, wenn wir ein Stück flußabwärts fahren und ihnen dort auflauern,« sagte Jones beflissen.\n",
      "Mittlerweile waren wir alle ungeduldig geworden, die Polizisten und Heizer eingeschlossen, die nur eine vage Ahnung von dem hatten, was hier vorging.\n",
      "»Wir können nichts als gesichert betrachten,« antwortete Holmes. »Es steht zehn zu eins, daß sie flußabwärts wollen, aber wir können nicht sicher sein.\n",
      "Von hier aus sehen wir die Einfahrt der Werft und sie können uns nicht sehen.\n",
      "Die Nacht ist wolkenlos und wir haben genügend Licht.\n",
      "Wir bleiben, wo wir sind.\n",
      "Sehen Sie nur, wieviel Leute unter den Gaslaternen passieren.«\n",
      "»Sie kommen alle von ihrer Arbeit auf der Werft.«\n",
      "»Dreckige Schurken, aber jeder hat einen unsterblichen Funken in sich verborgen.\n",
      "Man kann es ihnen nicht ansehen.\n",
      "Es gibt keine a-priori Wahrscheinlichkeit dafür.\n",
      "Welch seltsames Rätsel ist der Mensch!«\n",
      "»Jemand nannte es ›die Seele im Tier‹,« schlug ich vor.\n",
      "»Winwood Reade hat darüber gut geschrieben,« sagte Holmes. »Er sagte, daß der einzelne Mensch ein unlösbares Puzzle darstellt.\n",
      "Aber in der Gesamtheit gesehen ist er eine berechenbare Größe.\n",
      "So kann man nie vorhersagen, was ein Mensch gerade tun wird; aber ab einer gewissen Zahl können Sie es präzise vorhersagen.\n",
      "Die Individuen variieren, aber die Prozentzahlen bleiben konstant – sagt der Statistiker.\n",
      "Aber sehe ich dort nicht ein Taschentuch?\n",
      "Dort flattert doch etwas weißes.«\n",
      "»Ja, es ist ihr Junge,« rief ich. »Ich kann ihn genau erkennen.«\n",
      "»Und dort ist die Aurora,« rief Holmes, »und fährt wie der Teufel!\n",
      "Volle Kraft voraus!\n",
      "Folgen Sie der Barkasse mit dem gelben Licht.\n",
      "Um Himmels willen, ich verzeihe es mir nie, wenn wir ihr nicht auf den Fersen bleiben können!«\n",
      "Die Barkasse war unbemerkt durch das kleine Werfttor geschlüpft, passierte hinter einigen kleineren Schiffen und hatte Fahrt aufgenommen, bevor wir sie entdeckten.\n",
      "Nun flog sie flußabwärts, dicht am Ufer entlang und mit einer unglaublichen Geschwindigkeit.\n",
      "Jones sah sie besorgt an und schüttelte den Kopf.\n",
      "»Sie ist sehr schnell,« sagte er, »ich bezweifle, daß wir sie einholen können.«\n",
      "»Wir müssen sie einholen!« rief Holmes zwischen den Zähnen hindurch. »Schaufeln Sie, Heizer!\n",
      "Holen Sie alles aus ihr heraus!\n",
      "Und wenn auch die Kessel platzen, wir müssen sie haben!«\n",
      "Wir waren ihr jetzt ziemlich nahe.\n",
      "Die Brennöfen bullerten und die mächtigen Maschinen zischten und rasselten wie ein gewaltiges metallisches Herz.\n",
      "Der spitze, steile Bug zerschnitt das Wasser des Flusses und erzeugte auf beiden Seiten mächtige, sich brechende Wellen.\n",
      "Mit jedem Klopfen der Maschine hüpfte und zitterte das Schiff wie ein lebendiges Wesen.\n",
      "Eine große gelbe Laterne an unserem Bug warf ihren langen, flackernden Lichtkegel voraus.\n",
      "Genau voraus zeigt ein dunkler Fleck auf dem Wasser die Position der Aurora.\n",
      "Der hinter ihr aufgewirbelte weiße Schaum verriet das Tempo, mit dem sie vorwärtsschoß.\n",
      "Wir durchkreuzten den Kurs von kleinen Barken, Dampfschiffen, bald vorbei, bald dazwischen oder drum herum.\n",
      "Es hagelte Flüche aus der Dunkelheit; die Aurora donnerte voran und wir folgten ihr dicht dahinter.\n",
      "»Mehr Kohlen, mehr Kohlen!« schrie Holmes, als er in den Maschinenraum sah. Die Glut der Öfen beleuchtete sein ungeduldiges Adlergesicht. »Machen Sie Dampf, soviel nur geht.«\n",
      "»Ich glaube, wir haben ein wenig aufgeholt,« sagte Jones, der die Aurora beobachtete.\n",
      "»Ich glaube auch,« sagte ich. »Wir werden sie in ein paar Minuten eingeholt haben.«\n",
      "Wie es das Schicksal wollte, kam in diesem Moment ein Schlepper mit drei Lastkähnen im Schlepptau genau zwischen uns.\n",
      "Nur durch hartes Ruderlegen wurde ein Zusammenstoß vermieden, aber bevor wir den Schleppzug umrundeten, hatte die Aurora mehr als zweihundert Yards gewonnen.\n",
      "Aber sie war immer noch in guter Sichtweite und die unsichere Dämmerung verwandelte sich in eine sternklare Nacht.\n",
      "Unsere Kessel waren bis zum Äußersten beansprucht und der zerbrechliche Rumpf vibrierte und knarrte unter den gewaltigen Kräften, die uns vorantrieben.\n",
      "Wir hatten den Pool passiert, waren schon hinter den West India Docks, die lange Deptford Reach entlang und umrundeten die Isle of Dogs.\n",
      "Der dunkle Fleck vor uns löste sich auf und verwandelte sich zusehends in die zierliche Aurora.\n",
      "Jones richtete unsere Suchlampe auf sie, und wir konnten deutlich die Personen an Bord erkennen.\n",
      "Ein Mann saß im Heck und beugte sich über einen schwarzen Gegenstand zwischen seinen Knien.\n",
      "Neben ihm lag ein dunkles Etwas, das wie ein Neufundländer aussah.\n",
      "Der junge Smith hielt die Pinne.\n",
      "Im rotglänzenden Schein der Öfen sah ich den bis zur Hüfte nackten alten Smith, wie er um sein Leben Kohlen schaufelte.\n",
      "Sie mochten zuerst gezweifelt haben, ob wir ihnen wirklich folgten.\n",
      "Aber nun konnte kein Zweifel mehr daran sein, da wir ihnen bei jeder Wendung und Drehung folgten.\n",
      "In Höhe von Greenwich waren wir nur noch dreihundert Schritt von ihnen entfernt, in Blackwell waren es nur noch zweihundertfünfzig.\n",
      "In meinem wechselvollen Leben habe ich viele Kreaturen in den unterschiedlichsten Ländern gejagt, aber noch nie hatte der Jagdsport mir einen so aufregenden Nervenkitzel gegeben wie in dieser verrückten Menschenjagd auf der Themse.\n",
      "Yard um Yard kamen wir ihnen näher.\n",
      "In der nächtlichen Stille konnten wir das Keuchen und Stampfen ihrer Maschinen hören.\n",
      "Der Mann im Heck kauerte noch immer auf dem Deck und seine Arme bewegten sich geschäftig.\n",
      "Ab und zu schaute er hoch und maß die Entfernung zwischen den Schiffen.\n",
      "Wir kamen näher und näher.\n",
      "Jones rief ihnen zu, die Maschinen zu stoppen.\n",
      "Wir waren nur noch vier Bootslängen hinter ihnen, beide Schiffe mit einer gewaltigen Geschwindigkeit.\n",
      "Hier war der Flußverlauf ohne Biegungen, Barking Level auf der einen und die eintönigen Plumstead Marshes auf der anderen Seite.\n",
      "Auf unseren Zuruf hin sprang der Mann im Heck vom Deck auf, schüttelte seine geballten Fäuste gegen uns und fluchte in einer hohen, sich überschlagenden Stimme.\n",
      "Er war ein stämmiger, großer Mann.\n",
      "Als er sich an Deck ausbalancierte, sah ich, daß er auf der rechten Seite vom Oberschenkel an einen hölzernen Stumpf hatte.\n",
      "Beim Klang seiner scharfen, bösartigen Flüche bewegte sich das Bündel an Deck.\n",
      "Es richtete sich auf und wurde zu einem kleinen schwarzen Mann – dem kleinsten, den ich je gesehen hatte – mit einem großen, mißgestalteten Kopf und einem Büschel verfilzter, zerzauster Haare.\n",
      "Holmes hatte schon seinen Revolver gezogen und beim Anblick dieser wilden, verformten Kreatur zog auch ich meinen Revolver.\n",
      "Er war in eine Art dunkle Decke eingehüllt, die nur sein Gesicht freiließ; aber dieses Gesicht genügte, um jemanden schlaflose Nächte zu bescheren.\n",
      "Nie zuvor hatte ich solche Bestialität und Grausamkeit in einem Gesicht gesehen.\n",
      "Seine kleinen Augen glühten und brannten in düsterem Licht, seine dicken Lippen stülpten sich vor die Zähne, die uns mit nahezu tierischer Wut angrinsten und losschnatterten.\n",
      "»Feuern Sie, wenn er die Hand hebt,« sagte Holmes ruhig.\n",
      "Wir waren weniger als eine Bootslänge entfernt und konnten unsere Beute fast berühren.\n",
      "Ich konnte beide jetzt deutlich sehen, der Weiße mit seinen weit gespreizten Beinen, Geschrei und Flüche ausstoßend und daneben der heidnische Zwerg mit dem häßlichen Gesicht, dessen kräftige gelbe Zähne im Licht unserer Lampe knirschten.\n",
      "Es war vorteilhaft, daß wir ihn so deutlich sehen konnten.\n",
      "Trotz unseres Zusehens zog er aus seiner Körperbedeckung ein kurzes, rundes Holzstück hervor, das wie ein Zeigestock aussah und führte es an seine Lippen.\n",
      "Unsere Pistolen erklangen gleichzeitig.\n",
      "Er wirbelte herum, warf die Arme hoch und fiel mit einem würgenden Husten seitlich ins Wasser.\n",
      "Inmitten der weißen Wasserwirbel fing ich einen Blick seiner giftigen, drohenden Augen auf.\n",
      "Im gleichen Moment sprang der Mann mit dem Holzbein ans Ruder und riß es herum.\n",
      "Das Boot schoß aufs südliche Ufer zu, während wir knapp an seinem Heck im Abstand von wenigen Fuß vorbeischossen.\n",
      "Im nächsten Moment waren wir hinter dem Schiff, es war aber schon dicht an der Böschung.\n",
      "Es war ein wilder und öder Ort, der Mond beschien eine breite sumpfige Stelle, flaches stehendes Wasser und Sumpf mit absterbender Vegetation.\n",
      "Mit einem dumpfen Geräusch rutschte die Barkasse eine Schlammbank hinauf; der Bug ragte in die Luft, das Heck ins Wasser.\n",
      "Der Flüchtige sprang hinaus, aber sein Holzstumpf versank sofort im schlammigen Boden.\n",
      "Er kämpfte vergeblich, denn er konnte weder einen Schritt vorwärts noch einen Schritt zurück machen.\n",
      "Er schrie in ohnmächtiger Wut und trat mit dem gesunden Fuß krampfhaft in den Schlamm.\n",
      "Doch sein hölzerner Schaft sank nur immer weiter in den Schlamm.\n",
      "Als wir unsere Barkasse längsseits brachten, war er so fest im Schlick verankert, daß wir ihn nur herausziehen konnten, indem wir ein Seil über seine Schultern warfen.\n",
      "Wir konnten ihn wie einen großen Fisch über die Bordwand einholen.\n",
      "Die beiden Smiths, Vater und Sohn, saßen mürrisch auf dem Schiff und kamen auf unseren Befehl hin ohne Widerstreben an Bord.\n",
      "Wir zogen die Aurora von der Schlickbank und vertäuten sie an unserem Heck.\n",
      "Eine solide Truhe indischer Fabrikation stand an Deck.\n",
      "Sie mußte zweifellos den fluchbeladenen Schatz der Sholtos enthalten.\n",
      "Ein Schlüssel war nicht vorhanden und wir mußten das schwere Teil vorsichtig in unsere Kabine bugsieren.\n",
      "Während wir langsam wieder stromaufwärts dampften, leuchteten wir mit unserer Suchlampe in alle Richtungen, konnten aber keine Spur des Insulaner finden.\n",
      "Irgendwo im Schlamm am Boden der Themse liegen die Knochen dieses seltsamen Besuchers unserer Insel.\n",
      "»Schauen Sie,« sagte Holmes und zeigte zur hölzernen Luke. »Wir waren gerade schnell genug mit unseren Pistolen.« Und genau dort, wo wir vorhin gestanden hatten, steckte eines der mörderischen Geschosse, die wir so gut kannten.\n",
      "Es muß im gleichen Augenblick zwischen uns geflogen sein, als wir unsere Pistolen abfeuerten.\n",
      "Holmes lächelte darüber und zuckte in seiner leichtfertigen Art mit den Schultern.\n",
      "Aber ich gestehe, daß es mich krank machte, an den schrecklichen Tod zu denken, der uns diese Nacht so knapp verfehlt hatte.\n",
      "Der große Agra Schatz\n",
      "Unser Gefangener saß in der Kabine der großen eisernen Truhe gegenüber, für die er so viel angestellt hatte und auf die er so lange gewartet hatte.\n",
      "Er war ein sonnengebräunter Bursche mit ruhelosen Augen; die zahlloses Furchen und Falten seines mahagonifarbenen Gesicht verrieten ein hartes Leben unter freiem Himmel.\n",
      "Das vorstehende bärtige Kinn ließ einen Menschen erkennen, der nicht leicht von seinem einmal gewählten Weg abgebracht werden konnte.\n",
      "Er mußte um die fünfzig Jahre alt sein, denn das schwarze, lockige Haar war schon mit grauen Strähnen durchsetzt.\n",
      "Sein entspanntes Gesicht wirkte sympathisch, nur die dichten Augenbrauen und das energische Kinn erzeugten den grausamen Gesichtsausdruck, den ich noch kürzlich erlebt hatte.\n",
      "Er saß jetzt mit den gefesselten Händen in seinem Schoß, den Kopf leicht zur Brust gesenkt.\n",
      "Mit seinen scharfen, blitzenden Augen sah er auf die Kiste, die der Grund all seine Schandtaten war.\n",
      "Ich seinem starren und gefaßten Gesichtsausdruck fand ich mehr Trauer als Ärger.\n",
      "Und sobald er mich ansah, trat ein Anflug von Belustigung in seine Augen.\n",
      "»Nun, Jonathan Small,« sagte Holmes und zündete sich eine Zigarre an. »Es tut mir leid, daß es soweit gekommen ist.«\n",
      "»Mir geht es ebenso,« antwortete er geradeheraus. »Ich kann die Sache nicht rückgängig machen.\n",
      "Ich schwöre bei der Bibel, daß ich nie meine Hand gegen Sholto erhoben habe.\n",
      "Der kleine Höllenhund Tonga hat einen dieser verfluchten Pfeile auf ihn geschossen.\n",
      "Ich hatte damit nichts zu tun, Sir.\n",
      "Es war für mich ebenso schmerzlich wie bei einem nahen Verwandten.\n",
      "Ich habe den kleinen Teufel für diese Tat mit dem losen Ende des Taues verdroschen, aber es war passiert und konnte nicht rückgängig gemacht werden.«\n",
      "»Nehmen Sie eine Zigarre,« sagte Holmes. »Und Sie haben genug Gründe, einen guten Schluck aus meiner Flasche zu nehmen, so naß wie Sie sind.\n",
      "Wie konnten Sie von diesem kleinen schwächlichen Wesen annehmen, daß es Mr. Sholto überwältigt und aufhält, während Sie das Seil emporklettern?«\n",
      "»Sie wissen fast soviel, als wären Sie dabeigewesen, Sir.\n",
      "Eigentlich hatte ich niemanden im Zimmer erwartet.\n",
      "Ich kannte die Gewohnheiten der Hausbewohner recht gut; und es war gerade die Zeit, zu der Mr. Sholto normalerweise zum Supper hinuntergeht.\n",
      "Ich will Ihnen nichts verheimlichen, die Wahrheit wird meine beste Verteidigung sein.\n",
      "Wenn es der alte Major gewesen wäre, hätte ich es leicht mit ihm gehabt.\n",
      "Und ich hätte ihm ebensowenig angetan wie dieser Zigarre hier.\n",
      "Verflucht, warum mußte ich auf den jungen Sholto stoßen, mit dem ich nicht den geringsten Streit hatte.«\n",
      "»Sie wurden von Mr. Athelney Jones von Scotland Yard festgenommen.\n",
      "Er wird Sie in meine Wohnung bringen und ich werde Sie über die wahren Hintergründe der Geschichte befragen.\n",
      "Sie sollten ein volles Geständnis ablegen, ich bin sicher, daß es Ihnen weiterhilft.\n",
      "Ich kann vermutlich beweisen, daß das Gift so schnell wirkte, daß der Mann tot war, bevor Sie den Raum betraten.«\n",
      "»So war es, Sir.\n",
      "Noch nie in meinem Leben habe ich einen solchen Schrecken verspürt, wie als ich sein verzerrt grinsendes Gesicht und den zur Seite gefallenen Kopf sah, während ich durchs Fenster stieg.\n",
      "Es hat mich richtig erschüttert und ich hätte Tonga dafür getötet, wenn er nicht so schnell davongeklettert wäre.\n",
      "Deshalb vergaß er seine Keule und einige Pfeile, wie er mir später erzählte.\n",
      "Die haben Sie auf unsere Fährte geführt; doch wie Sie es anschließend geschafft haben, kann ich nicht sagen.\n",
      "Ich hege deshalb auch keinen Groll gegen Sie,« fuhr er mit einem bitteren Lächeln fort, »aber es ist dennoch verrückt, wo ich doch einen berechtigten Anspruch auf die Hälfte der Million habe.\n",
      "Die erste Hälfte meines Lebens habe ich beim Bau eines Wellenbrechers auf den Andamanen zugebracht und soll nun die andere Hälfte beim Bau von Entwässerungsgräben in Dartmoor zubringen.\n",
      "Verflucht sei der Tag, als ich das erste Mal den Händler Achmet sah und mit dem Agra Schatz in Berührung kam, der noch keinem seiner Besitzer Glück gebracht hat.\n",
      "Ihm brachte er den Tod, Major Sholto brachte er Angst und Schuldgefühle und mir brachte er lebenslange Knechtschaft.«\n",
      "In diesem Moment erschienen Athelney Jones rundes Gesicht und seine breiten Schultern in der Kabinentür.\n",
      "»Oh, ein richtiges Familientreffen,« bemerkte er. »Bekomme ich einen Schluck aus der Flasche, Holmes?\n",
      "Ich denke, wir dürfen uns gratulieren.\n",
      "Schade, daß wir den anderen nicht gefaßt haben.\n",
      "Holmes, Ihr Plan war sehr gut, wir brauchten sie nur einzuholen!«\n",
      "»Ende gut, alles gut,« sagte Holmes. »Aber ich hatte wirklich nicht erwartet, daß die Aurora ein derart schneller Schiff war.«\n",
      "»Smith sagt, daß sie eine der schnellsten Barkassen auf der Themse sei.\n",
      "Und hätte ihm noch ein weiterer Mann im Maschinenraum geholfen, hätten wir sie nicht erwischt.\n",
      "Er schwört, daß er nichts über den Norwood-Fall weiß.«\n",
      "»Das stimmt,« rief unser Gefangener, »er weiß kein Wort darüber.\n",
      "Ich habe sein Schiff nur ausgewählt, weil es solch ein Flitzer ist.\n",
      "Wir sagten ihm nichts und bezahlten ihn reichlich.\n",
      "Er hätte ein weiteres Geschenk erhalten, wenn wir unser Schiff Esmeralda in Gravesend erreicht hätten.\n",
      "Die Esmeralda sollte nach Brasilien fahren.«\n",
      "»Wenn er nichts Schlimmes getan hat, wird ihm auch nichts Schlimmes passieren.\n",
      "Wir fangen unsere Leute zwar schnell, verurteilen sie aber nicht ebenso schnell.« Es war amüsant festzustellen, wie schnell sich der wichtigtuerische Jones mit den Federn der geglückten Festnahme schmückte.\n",
      "Am leichten Lächeln in Holmes Gesicht konnte ich erkennen, daß er diese Worte wohl vernommen hatte.\n",
      "»Wir werden bald an der Brücke von Vauxhall sein,« sagte Jones. »Sie, Dr. Watson werden wir mit der Schatzkiste dort absetzen.\n",
      "Ich brauche Ihnen nicht zu sagen, daß ich hierbei eine schwere Verantwortung übernehme.\n",
      "Es ist sehr ungewöhnlich, aber versprochen ist versprochen.\n",
      "Um meiner Pflicht genüge zu tun, werde ich Ihnen einen Inspektor mitgeben, da Sie eine sehr kostbare Fracht befördern.\n",
      "Werden Sie fahren?«\n",
      "»Ja, ich werde fahren.«\n",
      "»Schade, daß es keinen Schlüssel gibt, sonst könnten wir zuvor eine Bestandsaufnahme machen.\n",
      "Sie werden sie aufbrechen müssen.\n",
      "Mister, wo ist der Schlüssel?«\n",
      "»Auf dem Grund der Themse,« war Smalls knappe Antwort.\n",
      "»Hm!\n",
      "Sie sollten uns keine unnötigen Schwierigkeiten machen.\n",
      "Wir hatten schon genug Arbeit durch Sie.\n",
      "Doktor, ich muß Sie jedenfalls warnen, vorsichtig zu sein.\n",
      "Bringen Sie die Kiste dann zur Baker Street zurück.\n",
      "Sie finden uns dort, bevor wir zur Wache fahren.«\n",
      "Man setzte mich in Vauxhall ab.\n",
      "In meiner Begleitung waren die schwere eiserne Kiste sowie ein gutmütiger freundlicher Inspektor.\n",
      "Nach einer Viertelstunde Fahrt erreichten wir das Haus von Mrs. Cecil Forrester.\n",
      "Die Bedienstete war über so späten Besuch überrascht.\n",
      "Sie erklärte uns, daß Mrs. Forrester diesen Abend ausgegangen war und wahrscheinlich spät zurückkäme.\n",
      "Miss Morstan war aber im Salon, also ging ich in den Salon hinein und nahm die Kiste mit, ließ aber den Inspektor im Wagen zurück.\n",
      "Sie saß am offenen Fenster und war in ein weißes, durchsichtiges Gewand gekleidet, das an Hals und Hüfte von leichten Tüchern gehalten wurde.\n",
      "Sie saß zurückgelehnt in einem Korbstuhl und das weiche Licht einer abgedunkelten Lampe fiel auf sie, spielte über ihr süßes, ernstes Gesicht und betonte mit einem schwachen, metallischen Schimmer die reiche Lockenpracht ihrer vollen Haare.\n",
      "Der weiße Arm und die Hand hingen über der Seite des Stuhls herab und ihre gesamte Haltung und Figur zeigten Zeichen von Schwermut.\n",
      "Beim Klang meiner Schritte sprang sie auf und ein Anflug von Überraschung und Freude färbte ihre blassen Wangen.\n",
      "»Ich hörte eine Droschke vorfahren,« sagte sie. »Ich glaubte, Mrs. Forrester wäre frühzeitig zurückgekommen.\n",
      "Nicht im Traum hätte ich daran gedacht, daß Sie es sein könnten.\n",
      "Welche Neuigkeiten bringen Sie mir?«\n",
      "»Ich bringe mehr als nur Neuigkeiten,« sagte ich und stellte die Kiste auf den Tisch. Ich sprach in aufgeräumter und ungestümer Art, obwohl mir schwer ums Herz war. »Ich bringe Ihnen etwas, das mehr wert ist als alle Nachrichten der Welt zusammen.\n",
      "Ich bringe Ihnen ein Vermögen.«\n",
      "Sie schaute auf die eiserne Kiste.\n",
      "»Ist dies der Schatz?« fragte sie mit sehr ruhiger Stimme.\n",
      "»Ja, es ist der große Agra-Schatz.\n",
      "Eine Hälfte gehört Ihnen, die andere Thaddeus Sholto.\n",
      "Jeder von Ihnen hat ein paar Hunderttausender.\n",
      "Stellen Sie sich das vor!\n",
      "Eine Jahresrente von zehntausend Pfund.\n",
      "Es gibt nur wenige Frauen in England, die reicher sind.\n",
      "Ist es nicht herrlich?«\n",
      "In meiner Freude hatte ich wohl ein wenig überreagiert und meine Glückwünsche erschienen ihr unglaubwürdig, denn ich sah, wie sie die Augenbrauen hochzog und mich seltsam ansah.\n",
      "»Wenn es mir gehört,« sagte sie, »dann verdanke ich es Ihnen.«\n",
      "»Nein, nein,« antwortete ich, »nicht mir, sondern meinem Freund Sherlock Holmes.\n",
      "Auch mit der größten Anstrengung hätte ich nicht alle Anhaltspunkte verfolgen können, die sein analytisches Denken hervorgebracht hat.\n",
      "Beinahe hätten wir noch im letzten Augenblick alles verloren.«\n",
      "»Bitte setzen Sie sich und erzählen Sie mir alles genau, Dr. Watson,« sagte sie.\n",
      "Ich berichtete kurz die Ereignisse seit der letzten Begegnung – Holmes neue Suchmethode, die Entdeckung der Aurora, das Erscheinen von Athelney Jones, unsere abendliche Expedition und die wilde Jagd auf der Themse.\n",
      "Sie hörte mit offenem Mund und glänzenden Augen der Erzählung unserer Abenteuer zu.\n",
      "Als ich vom Pfeil berichtete, der uns beinahe getroffen hätte, wurde sie so bleich, daß ich schon befürchtete, sie würde in Ohnmacht fallen.\n",
      "Als ich mich beeilte, ihr ein wenig Wasser ins Gesicht zu spritzen, sagte sie nur: »Ich bin schon wieder in Ordnung.\n",
      "Es war nur der Schock, als ich hörte, daß ich meine Freunde in solch schreckliche Gefahr gebracht habe.«\n",
      "»Das ist nun vorbei,« antwortete ich, »und es war nicht der Rede wert.\n",
      "Ich werde Ihnen keine weiteren verdrießlichen Einzelheiten erzählen.\n",
      "Wenden wir uns den schöneren Seiten zu.\n",
      "Hier ist der Schatz.\n",
      "Was gibt es schöneres?\n",
      "Man hat mich mit ihm zu Ihnen geschickt, denn Sie sind die erste, die den Schatz sehen sollen.«\n",
      "»Es würde mich schon interessieren,« sagte sie.\n",
      "Aber die Stimme hatte keinen begierigen Klang.\n",
      "Sie hatte zweifellos bemerkt, daß es unschicklich wäre, über diesen so schwer erworbenen Schatz gleichgültig zu sein.\n",
      "»Welch hübsche Kiste!« sagte sie und beugte sich darüber. »Sie ist vermutlich in Indien hergestellt worden.«\n",
      "»Ja, die Metallbearbeitung ist typisch für Benares.«\n",
      "»Und so schwer!« rief sie beim Versuch, die Kiste anzuheben. »Auch die Kiste muß sehr wertvoll sein.\n",
      "Wo ist der Schlüssel?«\n",
      "»Small warf ihn in die Themse,« antwortete ich. »Ich muß mir Mrs. Forresters Feuerhaken ausleihen.« An der Vorderseite befand sich ein dicker, breiter Verschluß in Form eines sitzenden Buddhas.\n",
      "Ich stieß das Ende des Feuerhakens darunter und hebelte ihn auf.\n",
      "Der Verschluß sprang mit einem lauten Schnappgeräusch auf.\n",
      "Mit zitternden Händen warf ich den Deckel zurück.\n",
      "Wir beide standen stumm vor Erstaunen da.\n",
      "Die Kiste war leer!\n",
      "Ihr Gewicht war nun nicht mehr verwunderlich.\n",
      "Die Metallarbeiten waren rundherum etwa zweidrittel Zoll dick.\n",
      "Die Kiste war massiv, gut verarbeitet und solide, wie eine Truhe, die wertvolle Dinge enthalten sollte.\n",
      "Aber nicht die geringste Spur von Juwelen oder Edelmetall lagen darin.\n",
      "Die Kiste war vollkommen und absolut leer.\n",
      "»Der Schatz ist fort,« sagte Miss Morstan gefaßt.\n",
      "Als ich ihre Worte vernahm und deren Bedeutung begriff, fiel mir ein schwerer Stein vom Herzen.\n",
      "Jetzt, wo der Agra Schatz fort war, bemerkte ich erst, wie sehr er mich bedrückt hatte.\n",
      "Obwohl es unehrlich, treulos und selbstsüchtig war, bemerkte ich nur, daß sich die goldene Barriere zwischen uns aufgelöst hatte.\n",
      "»Gott sei Dank!« stieß ich aus ganzem Herzen hervor.\n",
      "Sie sah mich mit einem schnellen fragenden Lächeln an.\n",
      "»Warum sagen sie das?« fragte sie.\n",
      "»Weil Sie nun wieder für mich erreichbar sind,« sagte ich und nahm ihre Hand. Sie zog sie nicht zurück. »Weil ich Sie liebe, Mary.\n",
      "So sehr, wie kaum ein Mann eine Frau jemals geliebt hat.\n",
      "Dieses Schatz, dieser Reichtum haben meine Lippen versiegelt.\n",
      "Nun, wo alles fort ist, kann ich Ihnen sagen, wie sehr ich Sie liebe.\n",
      "Darum sagte ich ›Gott sei Dank‹.«\n",
      "»Dann sage auch ich ›Gott sei Dank‹«, flüsterte sie, als ich sie an mich zog.\n",
      "Auch wenn jemand in dieser Nacht einen Schatz verlor, ich hatte einen gewonnen.\n",
      "Die seltsame Geschichte von Jonathan Small\n",
      "Der Inspektor war geduldig im Wagen geblieben, obwohl er lange auf meine Rückkehr warten mußte.\n",
      "Seine Miene verdüsterte sich, als ich ihm die leere Kiste zeigte.\n",
      "»Weg ist die Belohnung!« sagte er düster. »Wo kein Geld ist, ist auch keine Bezahlung.\n",
      "Diese Nachtschicht hätten mir und Sam Brown jeweils zehn Pfund bringen können, wenn der Schatz dagewesen wäre.«\n",
      "»Mr.\n",
      "Thaddeus Sholto ist reich,« sagte ich. »Er wird dafür sorgen, daß Sie belohnt werden; und das auch ohne Schatz.«\n",
      "Der Inspektor schüttelte seinen Kopf mutlos.\n",
      "»Schlechte Arbeit,« wiederholte er, »und das gleiche wird Mr. Athelney Jones denken.«\n",
      "Seine Vorhersage war richtig.\n",
      "Der Detektiv war mehr als verblüfft, als ich ihm die leere Kiste zeigte.\n",
      "Er, Holmes und der Gefangene waren gerade eben angekommen.\n",
      "Sie hatten ihren Plan geändert und unterwegs ihren Bericht auf der Wache abgegeben.\n",
      "Mein Begleiter lümmelte sich mit seinem typischen teilnahmslosen Blick in einen Lehnstuhl.\n",
      "Small saß ihm aufrecht gegenüber und hatte das hölzerne Bein über das gesunde gelegt.\n",
      "Als ich die leere Kiste zeigte, lehnte er sich in seinen Stuhl zurück und lachte laut auf.\n",
      "»Das war Ihr Werk, Small,« sagte Athelney Jones ärgerlich.\n",
      "»Ja, ich habe es an einen Ort gebracht, wo Sie es nie finden werden,« rief er frohlockend. »Es ist mein Schatz, und wenn ich diese Beute nicht haben kann, werde ich dafür sorgen, daß niemand sie bekommt.\n",
      "Kein Lebender hat das Recht daran, außer mir und drei anderen Männern aus den Strafbaracken der Andamanen.\n",
      "Nun weiß ich, daß weder sie noch ich allein jemals davon Gebrauch machen können.\n",
      "Ich habe sowohl für sie wie auch für mich gearbeitet.\n",
      "Aber das Zeichen der Vier war immer dabei.\n",
      "Sie hätten es ebenso wie ich getan, und den Schatz lieber in der Themse versenkt als ihn den Freunden oder Erben von Sholto oder Morstan zu geben.\n",
      "Was wir für Achmet taten, sollte keinen reich machen.\n",
      "Der Schatz ist dort, wo der Schlüssel ist – und wo der kleine Tonga ist.\n",
      "Als ich sah, daß uns die Barkasse erwischt, habe ich die Beute an eine sichere Stelle gebracht.\n",
      "Und Sie sehen keine Rupie davon.«\n",
      "»Sie belügen uns, Small,« sagte Athelney Jones streng. »Falls Sie den Schatz in die Themse werfen wollten, wäre es einfacher gewesen, die gesamte Kiste zu versenken.«\n",
      "»Ich hätte sie einfach geworfen und Sie hätten Sie einfacher gefunden,« antwortete er mit einem schlauen Seitenblick. »Wer klug genug ist, mich zu jagen, ist auch klug genug, eine Eisenkiste auf dem Grund eines Flusses zu heben.\n",
      "Nun, wo alles über fünf Meilen verstreut liegt, wird es eine schwierigere Arbeit werden.\n",
      "Es fiel mir schwer, das zu tun.\n",
      "Ich war wie von Sinnen, als Sie immer näher kamen.\n",
      "Aber man braucht darüber nicht zu trauern.\n",
      "Mein Leben hatte Höhen und Tiefen, aber über verschüttete Milch sollte man nicht trauern.«\n",
      "»Das spricht schwer gegen Sie, Small,« sagte der Detektiv. »Wenn Sie der Justiz geholfen hätten, anstatt uns so zu behindern, wäre das Urteil vor Gericht günstiger für Sie ausgefallen.«\n",
      "»Gerechtigkeit,« stieß der Ex-Sträfling hervor. »Eine schöne Gerechtigkeit!\n",
      "Wem anders gehört der Kies als uns?\n",
      "Ist es gerecht, wenn ich es denen gebe, die es nicht verdient haben?\n",
      "Denken Sie daran, wie ich es verdient habe!\n",
      "Zwanzig Jahre im fieberverseuchten Sumpf, tägliche Arbeit zwischen den Mangroven, jede Nacht angekettet in den dreckigen Hütten der Zwangsarbeiter, gestochen von Moskitos, von Schüttelfrost gequält und von jedem verfluchten schwarzen Wächter tyrannisiert, der sich gegen einen Weißen aufspielen wollte.\n",
      "So habe ich mir den Agra-Schatz verdient.\n",
      "Und Sie reden mir über Gerechtigkeit, nur weil ich es nicht ertragen kann, daß sich jemand anderes an dem Preis ergötzt, den ich bezahlt habe!\n",
      "Ich würde lieber am Galgen baumeln oder einen von Tongas Pfeilen in der Haut haben, als in einer Gefängniszelle zu leben und zu wissen, daß jemand anders mit dem Geld, das eigentlich mir gehört, es sich in einem Palast wohl gehen läßt.« Small hatte seine gleichmütige Maske abgeworfen und alles kam in einem wilden Wirbel von Worten heraus.\n",
      "Seine Augen loderten und die Handschellen schlugen bei den leidenschaftlichen Bewegungen seiner Hände zusammen.\n",
      "Als ich die Wut und Leidenschaft dieses Mannes sah, konnte ich verstehen, daß Mr. Sholto nicht ohne Grund mit Horror reagierte, als er bemerkte, daß der Verbrecher ihm auf der Spur war.\n",
      "»Sie vergessen, daß wir nichts darüber wissen,« sagte Holmes ruhig. »Wir kennen Ihre Geschichte nicht; und wir wissen auch nicht, inwieweit die Gerechtigkeit auf Ihrer Seite steht.«\n",
      "»Nun Sir, bisher waren Sie sehr höflich zu mir, obwohl ich weiß, daß ich diese Armbänder um meinen Handgelenken Ihnen verdanke.\n",
      "Aber ich habe noch immer keinen Groll gegen Sie.\n",
      "Bisher war es gerecht und ehrlich.\n",
      "Wenn Sie meine Geschichte hören wollen, werde ich sie nicht verschweigen.\n",
      "Jedes Wort, das ich Ihnen sage, ist wahr.\n",
      "Danke, Sie können das Glas hier abstellen, ich nehme einen Schluck, wenn mir die Kehle trocken wird.\n",
      "»Ich stamme aus Worcestershire und bin in der Nähe von Pershore geboren.\n",
      "Wenn Sie dort nachsehen, werden Sie eine Haufen Smalls finden.\n",
      "Ich wollte oft einmal einen Blick dorthin werfen, aber um ehrlich zu sein, ich hatte keinen guten Ruf in der Familie.\n",
      "Ich glaube nicht, daß man mich gern sehen würde.\n",
      "Es waren alles zuverlässige Kirchgänger, kleine Bauern, im Umkreis wohlbekannt und respektiert.\n",
      "Ich hingegen war ein Vagabund.\n",
      "Als ich ungefähr achtzehn war, hörte ich auf Ihnen Ärger zu machen.\n",
      "Ich hatte ein Verhältnis mit einem Mädchen und konnte mich nur dadurch entwinden, indem ich das Handgeld nahm und den Third Buffs beitrat, die gerade nach Indien verlegt wurden.\n",
      "»Vom Soldatenleben bekam ich nicht viel mit.\n",
      "Ich beherrschte gerade den Paradeschritt und konnte meine Muskete bedienen, als ich so dumm war, im Ganges zu schwimmen.\n",
      "Glücklicherweise war mein Kompanie-Feldwebel John Holder zusammen mit mir im Wasser; und er war einer der besten Schwimmer des Regiments.\n",
      "Als ich den Fluß halb durchquert hatte, erwischte mich ein Krokodil und biß mir das rechte Bein genau über dem Knie ab.\n",
      "Ein Chirurg hätte es nicht sauberer durchführen können.\n",
      "Durch den Schock und den Blutverlust verlor ich die Besinnung und wäre ertrunken, wenn Holder mich nicht gepackt hätte und mit mir ans Ufer geschwommen wäre.\n",
      "Ich war fünf Monate im Hospital.\n",
      "Als ich endlich dazu fähig war, es mit meinem hölzernen Fuß am Beinstumpf zu verlassen, fand ich mich als Invalide aus der Armee entlassen und war ungeeignet für irgendeinen aktiven Beruf.\n",
      "»Wie Sie sich vorstellen können, war ich damals ziemlich vom Glück verlassen.\n",
      "Ich war noch keine zwanzig Jahre alt und doch schon ein Krüppel ohne Chancen.\n",
      "Jedoch stellte sich mein Unglück im nachhinein als Segen heraus.\n",
      "Ein Mann mit dem Namen Abelwhite, er war als Indigo-Pflanzer dorthin gekommen, suchte einen Aufseher für seine Kulis, auch um sie zur Arbeit anzutreiben.\n",
      "Er war zufällig ein Freund des Colonels, der sich seit meinem Unfall um mich kümmerte.\n",
      "Um es kurz zu machen, empfahl mich der Colonel wärmstens.\n",
      "Da ich hauptsächlich zu Pferd arbeiten mußte, war mein Bein kein großes Hindernis, da ich mich mit den Knien gut im Sattel festhalten konnte.\n",
      "Ich mußte auf der Plantage umherreiten, die Männer bei der Arbeit beobachten und die säumigen Arbeiter melden.\n",
      "Ich erhielt einen angemessenen Lohn, war gut untergebracht und war im Großen und Ganzen damit zufrieden, den Rest meines Lebens auf der Indigo-Plantage zu verbringen.\n",
      "Mr. Abelwhite war ein netter Mann; er kam oft in meine kleine Hütte und rauchte ein Pfeifchen Tabak mit mir.\n",
      "Weiße fühlen sich im Ausland einander viel näher als sie es sich zu Hause wären.\n",
      "»Das Glück dauert bei mir nie lange.\n",
      "Ohne ein vorheriges Warnzeichen brach bei uns eine Meuterei los.\n",
      "Lag Indien im ersten Monat noch still und friedlich wie Surrey oder Kent da, waren im nächsten Monat zweihunderttausend schwarze Teufel losgelassen und das Land war eine richtige Hölle.\n",
      "Sicher wissen Sie alles darüber, Gentlemen – vielleicht mehr als ich, da das Lesen nicht meine große Stärke ist.\n",
      "Ich weiß nur, was ich mit eigenen Augen gesehen habe.\n",
      "Unsere Plantage befand sich an Rand der nordwestlichen Provinzen bei einem Ort namens Muttra.\n",
      "Nacht für Nacht war der ganze Himmel vom Licht brennender Bungalows erhellt, und Tag für Tag kamen kleine Gruppen von Europäern mit ihren Frauen und Kindern durch unsere Plantage, alle auf dem Weg nach Agra, wo sich die nächsten Truppen befanden.\n",
      "Mr. Abelwhite war ein hartnäckiger Mann.\n",
      "Er hatte es sich in den Kopf gesetzt, daß die ganze Angelegenheit übertrieben wurde und sich schneller legen würde als sie aufgekommen war.\n",
      "So saß er auf der Veranda, trank sein Gläschen Whiskey und rauchte seinen Stumpen, während das Land um ihn herum in Aufruhr war.\n",
      "Natürlich hielten wir zu ihm, ich und Dawson, der gemeinsam mit seiner Frau die Buchhaltung und Plantagenverwaltung machte.\n",
      "Und eines schönen Tages kam es zum Knall.\n",
      "Ich war auf einer abgelegeneren Plantage und ritt am Abend langsam heim, als mein Auge auf etwas fiel, das als Haufen am Boden einer tiefen Senke lag.\n",
      "Ich ritt hin, um es zu sehen, was es war und mir fuhr es kalt durchs Herz, als ich Dawson's Frau fand, vollständig in Streifen zerschnitten und schon zur Hälfte von Schakalen und Hunden aufgefressen.\n",
      "Ein Stück weiter die Straße hinauf lag Dawson bäuchlings und offensichtlich tot.\n",
      "Er hatte einen leergeschossenen Revolver in der Hand, vier Sepoys lagen übereinander direkt vor ihm.\n",
      "Ich hielt mein Pferd im Zaum und dachte über den einzuschlagenden Weg nach.\n",
      "Im gleichen Moment quoll dicker Rauch aus Abelwhite's Bungalow, die Flammen schossen durch das Dach.\n",
      "Da wußte ich, daß ich meinem Arbeitgeber nicht mehr helfen konnte, sondern durch eine Einmischung nur das eigene Leben riskieren würde.\n",
      "Von meinem Standpunkt aus konnte ich Hunderte von schwarzen Teufeln sehen, die mit ihren roten Umhängen das brennende Haus mit Geheul umtanzten.\n",
      "Man zeigte auf mich und ein paar Kugeln pfiffen mir um den Kopf.\n",
      "Ich machte mich über die Reisfelder davon und war spät nachts innerhalb der sicheren Mauern von Agra.\n",
      "»Doch die erwartete Sicherheit war trügerisch.\n",
      "Das ganze Land war in Aufruhr wie ein Bienenschwarm.\n",
      "Wo sich Engländer in kleinen Gruppen sammeln konnten, vermochten sie nur soviel Boden zu behaupten, soweit ihre Pistolen reichten.\n",
      "Überall sonst waren sie hilflose Flüchtlinge.\n",
      "Es war ein Kampf von Millionen gegen Hunderte.\n",
      "Am schlimmsten daran war, daß die Männer, gegen die wir kämpften, unsere eigenen, von uns ausgebildeten Truppen waren.\n",
      "Fußvolk, Berittene und Schützen, wir hatten sie alle ausgebildet, und nun kämpften sie gegen uns mit unseren eigenen Waffen und sie verwendeten unsere Signalhörner.\n",
      "In Agra waren die Dritten Bengalischen Füsiliere stationiert, einige Sikhs, zwei berittene Schwadrone und eine Batterie Artillerie.\n",
      "Ein Freiwilligenkorps aus Angestellten und Kaufleuten wurde aufgestellt, dem ich mit meinem Holzbein beitrat.\n",
      "Wir zogen los, um die Rebellen Anfang Juli bei Shahgunge zu stellen und konnten sie einige Zeit zurückschlagen.\n",
      "Dann ging uns das Pulver aus und wir mußten uns in die Stadt zurückziehen.\n",
      "Aus allen Richtungen kamen nur die schlimmsten Nachrichten – kein Wunder, wenn Sie sich die Karte ansehen, werden Sie feststellen, daß wir im Zentrum der Rebellion lagen.\n",
      "Lucknow liegt mehr als einhundert Meilen östlich und Cawnpore gleich weit entfernt im Süden.\n",
      "Aus jeder Kompaßrichtung kamen nur Nachrichten über Folter, Mord und Frevel.\n",
      "»Agra ist ein großartiger Ort, alle Sorten von Fanatikern und Teufelsanbetern schwirren dort herum.\n",
      "Unsere Handvoll Männer war in den schmalen, gewundenen Straßen verloren.\n",
      "Daher ging unser Anführer mit uns auf die andere Seite des Flusses und bezog im alten Fort von Agra Stellung.\n",
      "Ich weiß nicht, ob jemand von Ihnen etwas über dieses alte Fort gehört oder gelesen hat.\n",
      "Es ist ein sehr eigenartiger Ort – der seltsamste, an dem ich mich jemals befunden habe, und ich bin schon an einigen gewesen.\n",
      "Erst einmal hatte das Fort eine gewaltige Ausdehnung.\n",
      "Es muß einige Morgen umfasst haben.\n",
      "Den neueren Teil bewohnte unsere Garnison mit Ehefrauen, Kindern und auch Geschäften auf viel freiem Platz.\n",
      "Der neuere Teil ist nichts gegen das alte Viertel, das den Skorpionen und Tausendfüßlern überlassen wurde.\n",
      "Es ist voller großer verlassener Hallen und gewundener Gänge, in denen man sich leicht verlaufen kann.\n",
      "Deshalb ging selten jemand hinein, ab und zu vielleicht einmal eine mit Fackeln bewaffnete Gruppe.\n",
      "»Der Fluß fließt direkt vor der Stirnseite des Forts und schützt es so.\n",
      "Aber an den Seiten und im hinteren Teil gab es viele Türen.\n",
      "Diese mußten sowohl im alten Viertel wie auch im von unseren Truppen bewohnten Teil bewacht werden.\n",
      "Wir waren nicht genügend Leute, um alle Winkel des Gebäudes zu besetzen und auch noch zu kämpfen.\n",
      "Es war deshalb unmöglich, eine starke Wache an jedem der unzähligen Tore zu postieren.\n",
      "Wir konnten nur ein zentrales Wachhaus in der Mitte des Forts einrichten; jedes Tor wurde in die Obhut eines Weißen und zwei oder drei Eingeborenen gegeben.\n",
      "Ich wurde zur nächtlichen Bewachung eines kleinen, abgelegenen Tores an der südwestlichen Seite des Gebäudes abkommandiert.\n",
      "Zwei Sikh-Soldaten wurden unter meinen Befehl gestellt und ich erhielt die Anweisung, einen Musketenschuß abzugeben, wenn etwas schiefging.\n",
      "Ich sollte mich dann auf die Hilfe vom zentralen Wachhaus verlassen können.\n",
      "Da die Wache mehr als zweihundert Schritt entfernt lag und der Raum dazwischen von einem Labyrinth von Gängen und Korridoren durchschnitten war, hatte ich große Zweifel, ob man uns im Falle eines Angriffs rechtzeitig zur Hilfe kommen könnte.\n",
      "»Ich war sehr stolz auf diesen kleinen Befehl, denn ich war ein junger Rekrut und dazu noch lahm.\n",
      "Zwei Nächte lang hielt ich mit meinen Punjabis Wache.\n",
      "Es waren große, wild aussehende Kerle, sie hießen Mahomet Singh und Abdulla Khan, beide alte Kämpfer, die gegen uns in Chilian-wallah gekämpft hatten.\n",
      "Sie sprachen recht gutes Englisch, aber ich konnte nicht viel aus ihnen herausbekommen.\n",
      "Sie standen lieber die ganze Nacht zusammen und quatschten in ihrer seltsamen Sikh-Muttersprache.\n",
      "Ich stand gewöhnlich außerhalb des Torweges und beobachtete den breiten, sich schlängelnden Fluß und die blinkenden Lichter der Stadt.\n",
      "Das Dröhnen der Trommeln und das Geschrei und Geheul der von Opium und Ganja berauschten Rebellen führte uns immer wieder die Gefährlichkeit unsere Widersacher auf der anderen Flußseite vor Augen.\n",
      "Der wachhabende Offizier kam alle zwei Stunden bei den Posten vorbei, um zu sehen, ob alles in Ordnung war.\n",
      "»Die dritte Nacht unserer Wache war dunkel und leichter Nieselregel machte sie noch trüber.\n",
      "Stundenlang in solchem Wetter im Torweg zu stehen war eine langweilige Sache.\n",
      "Ich versuchte immer wieder vergeblich, meine Sikhs zum Reden zu bewegen.\n",
      "Um zwei Uhr Nachts unterbrach der Kontrollgang die Eintönigkeit für einen Moment.\n",
      "Da ich wußte, daß meine Begleiter nicht zur Konversation zu bewegen waren, nahm ich meine Pfeife heraus und stellte die Muskete ab, um ein Streichholz zu entzünden.\n",
      "Im gleichen Moment fielen die zwei Sikhs über mich her.\n",
      "Einer hob meine Flinte auf und zielte damit auf meinen Kopf, der andere hielt mir ein großes Messer an die Kehle und schwor ingrimmig, daß er es benutzen würde, wenn ich auch nur die geringste Bewegung machte.\n",
      "»Mein erster Gedanke war, daß die beiden Kerle mit den Rebellen verbündet waren und dies der Beginn eines Überfalls war.\n",
      "Sollte unser Tor fallen, würde mit den Frauen und Kindern ebenso wie in Cawnpore verfahren werden.\n",
      "Die Gentlemen glauben vielleicht, daß ich mich damit brüsten will, aber ich gebe Ihnen mein Ehrenwort, daß ich trotz des Messers an der Kehle im Begriff war, mit einem Hilferuf die Hauptwache zu alarmieren, selbst wenn das mein letzter Ausruf gewesen sein sollte.\n",
      "Der Mann, der mich festhielt, schien meine Gedanken zu erraten und flüsterte: ›Machen Sie keinen Lärm, das Fort ist nicht in Gefahr.\n",
      "Auf dieser Seite des Flusses ist keiner der rebellierenden Hunde.\n",
      "‹ Es war ein Klang von Ehrlichkeit in seiner Stimme und ich wußte, ein Schrei hätte meinen Tod bedeutet.\n",
      "Das jedenfalls las ich aus den Augen des braunhäutigen Gesellen.\n",
      "So wartete ich schweigend zu hören, was sie von mir wollten.\n",
      "»›Hören Sie, Sahib,‹ sagte der größer und wilder erscheinende, der auf den Namen Abdullah Khan hörte.\n",
      "›Entweder halten Sie zu uns oder wir werden Sie für immer zum Schweigen bringen.\n",
      "Die Sache ist uns zu wichtig, als daß wir zögern würden.\n",
      "Entweder sind sie voll und ganz auf unserer Seite, und schwören dies auf das Kreuz der Christen, oder Ihr Leichnam wird noch diese Nacht in den Graben geworfen und wir laufen zu unseren Brüdern in der Rebellenarmee über.\n",
      "Es gibt keine Kompromisse.\n",
      "Was wählen Sie, Tod oder Leben?\n",
      "Wir geben Ihnen nur drei Minuten zum Überlegen, denn die Zeit rennt und alles muß erledigt sein, ehe der nächste Rundgang gemacht wird.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»›Wie soll ich mich entscheiden‹, sagte ich, ›Wenn ihr mir noch nicht einmal erzählt habt, was ihr von mir verlangt.\n",
      "Ich sage euch aber, wenn es gegen die Sicherheit des Forts gerichtet ist, will ich nichts damit zu tun haben.\n",
      "Dann benutzt das Messer besser sofort.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»›Es ist nicht gegen das Fort gerichtet,‹ sagte er.\n",
      "›Wir bitten Sie nur, das gleiche zu tun, weswegen Ihre Landsleute hierher gekommen sind.\n",
      "Wir machen Sie reich.\n",
      "Wenn Sie heute Nacht zu uns stehen, schwören wir hier beim blanken Messer und beim dreifachen Schwur, den kein Sikh je brechen wird, daß Sie Ihren gerechten Anteil an der Beute erhalten werden.\n",
      "Ein Viertel des Schatzes soll Ihnen gehören.\n",
      "Mehr können wir Ihnen nicht anbieten.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»›Und woraus besteht der Schatz?\n",
      "‹ fragte ich.\n",
      "›Ich bin ebenso wie ihr an Reichtum interessiert.\n",
      "Aber sagt mir erst, wie es geschehen soll.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»›Dann schwören Sie bei den Gebeinen Ihres Vaters, bei der Ehre Ihrer Mutter und beim Zeichen Ihres Glaubens, daß Sie weder heute noch später Hand gegen uns erheben oder ein Wort gegen uns sagen werden.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»›Das schwöre ich,‹ antwortete ich, ›falls das Fort nicht gefährdet wird.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»›Dann schwören mein Freund und ich, daß Sie ein Viertel des Schatzes erhalten werden.\n",
      "Er soll zu gleichen Teilen unter uns aufgeteilt werden.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»›Aber wir sind nur drei,‹ sagte ich.\n",
      "»›Nein, auch Dost Akhbar erhält seinen Teil.\n",
      "Wir erzählen Ihnen die Geschichte, während wir auf ihn warten.\n",
      "Mahomet Singh, stelle dich an die Pforte und sag uns, wenn sie kommen.\n",
      "Die Sache ist folgendermaßen, Sahib.\n",
      "Ich erzähle sie Ihnen nur, weil ein Eid für einen Weißen verbindlich ist und wir Ihnen daher nun trauen können.\n",
      "Wären Sie ein lügnerischer Hindu gewesen, der bei allen Göttern seines falschen Tempels geschworen hätte, Ihr Blut wäre bereits am Messer und Ihr Leichnam im Wasser.\n",
      "Aber die Sikhs kennen die Engländer gut und umgekehrt.\n",
      "Hören Sie also, was ich Ihnen sage.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»›In den nördlichen Provinzen gibt es einen Rajah, dessen Land klein ist, aber sein Reichtum groß.\n",
      "Viel hatte er bereits durch seinen Vater, aber noch mehr hat er selbst hinzugewonnen, denn er hütet sein Gold lieber, statt es auszugeben.\n",
      "Als die Unruhen ausbrachen, wollte er sowohl mit dem Löwen wie auch mit dem Tiger gut Freund sein – den Sepoys und dem Raj der Company.\n",
      "Aber schon bald bemerkte er, daß die Tage des weißen Mannes gezählt waren.\n",
      "Denn überall im Land hörte er nur von ihrem Tod und den Niederlagen.\n",
      "Er war ein vorsichtiger Mann und plante so, daß ihm mindestens die Hälfte des Schatzes verbliebe, komme was wolle.\n",
      "Alles Gold und Silber beließ er in seiner Schatzkammer, aber die kostbarsten Edelsteine und wertvollsten Perlen tat er in eine eiserne Kiste und sandte sie durch einen als Händler verkleideten Diener ins Fort von Agra.\n",
      "Dort sollten sie bleiben, bis wieder Frieden war.\n",
      "Sollten die Rebellen gewinnen, hätte er sein Geld, beim Sieg der Ostindischen Kompanie wären ihm die Juwelen sicher.\n",
      "So teilte er seinen Schatz und schlug sich auf die Seite der Sepoys, die schon an seinen Landesgrenzen standen.\n",
      "Und so, Sahib, kam sein Besitz in die Obhut intimster Vertrauter.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»›Der angebliche Händler, der unter dem Namen Achmet reiste, ist jetzt in der Stadt und möchte ins Fort gelangen.\n",
      "Sein Begleiter ist mein Stiefbruder Dost Akbar, der das Geheimnis kennt.\n",
      "Dost Akbar versprach ihm, ihn durch ein Seitentor ins Fort zu bringen und hat dieses Tor dafür ausgewählt.\n",
      "Er wird bald hier sein und Mahomet Singh und mich hier treffen.\n",
      "Dieser Ort ist einsam, und niemand weiß, daß er kommt.\n",
      "Von Achmet wird man nie wieder etwas hören, aber der Schatz des Radschahs wird unter uns aufgeteilt.\n",
      "Was halten Sie davon, Sahib?\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»In Worcestershire ist uns das Leben eines Menschen heilig.\n",
      "Aber die Dinge liegen anders, wenn Feuer und Blut um einen herum sind und man dem Tod an jeder Ecke begegnet.\n",
      "Leben oder Tod des Händlers Achmet hatten kein Gewicht für mich.\n",
      "Aber die Geschichte vom Schatz hatte von meinen Gedanken Besitz ergriffen und ich dachte daran, wie ich in der alten Heimat angestarrt werden würde, wenn der Nichtsnutz mit den Taschen voller Louisdor plötzlich auftauchen würde.\n",
      "Ich hatte mich schon längst entschlossen.\n",
      "Abdullah Khan glaubte mich noch zögernd und bedrängte mich weiter.\n",
      "»›Sehen Sie, Sahib,‹ sagte er, ›Wenn der Kommandant ihn erwischt, wird er gehängt oder erschossen.\n",
      "Die Juwelen werden von der Regierung beschlagnahmt, und niemand wird eine Rupie davon je wiedersehen.\n",
      "Wenn wir sie ihm aber abnehmen, kommt es auf dasselbe raus.\n",
      "Die Juwelen sind bei uns ebenso gut aufgehoben wie in der Schatzkammer der Company.\n",
      "Jeder von uns wäre reich und ein gemachter Mann.\n",
      "Keiner weiß etwas darüber, denn wir sind hier allein.\n",
      "Wie könnte es besser sein?\n",
      "Sagen Sie nun, Sahib, ob Sie mitmachen oder wir Sie als unseren Feind betrachten müssen.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»›Ich bin mit Herz und Seele dabei,‹ sagte ich.\n",
      "»›Das ist gut,‹ sagte er und gab mir meine Waffe zurück.\n",
      "›Wir trauen Ihnen, und Ihr Wort und auch das unsrige soll nicht gebrochen werden.\n",
      "Nun müssen wir nur noch auf meinen Bruder und den Händler warten.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»›Kennt dein Bruder unsere Absichten,‹ fragte ich.\n",
      "»›Es ist sein Plan, er hat ihn sich ausgedacht.\n",
      "Wir gehen jetzt zum Tor und wachen zusammen mit Mahomet Singh.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»Es regnete noch immer, denn die Regenzeit hatte gerade begonnen.\n",
      "Schwere, dunkle Wolken trieben über den Himmel und man sah keinen Steinwurf weit.\n",
      "Ein tiefer Wassergraben war vor unserem Tor, aber er war stellenweise noch ausgetrocknet und konnte leicht durchquert werden.\n",
      "Es war mir unheimlich, dort mit zwei wilden Punjabees zu stehen und auf den Mann zu warten, der zu seinem eigenen Tod hier erschien.\n",
      "»Plötzlich fiel mein Auge auf den Schimmer einer abgeschatteten Laterne, die auf der anderen Seite des Wassergrabens erschien.\n",
      "Sie verschwand zwischen den Schlammhügeln und kam dann langsam in unsere Richtung.\n",
      "»›Da sind sie,‹ rief ich.\n",
      "»›Überprüfen Sie sie wie üblich, Sahib,‹ flüsterte Abdullah.\n",
      "›Sie sollen keinen Verdacht schöpfen.\n",
      "Befehlen Sie uns zur Begleitung und wir besorgen alles, während Sie hier weiter Wache stehen.\n",
      "Halten Sie die Laterne bereit, damit wir erkennen, ob es der richtige Mann ist.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»Das Licht war flackernd nähergekommen, hielt an und kam wieder näher, bis ich zwei dunkle Gestalten auf der anderen Seite des Grabens erkennen konnte.\n",
      "Ich ließ sie die schräge Grabenwand herunterklettern, sie spritzen durch den Morast und kletterten halb zum Tor hinauf, bevor ich sie anrief.\n",
      "»›Wer ist da?\n",
      "‹ sagte ich mit ruhiger Stimme.\n",
      "»›Freunde,‹ kam die Antwort.\n",
      "Ich deckte meine Laterne auf und richtete den vollen Lichtschein auf sie.\n",
      "Der erste war ein gewaltiger Sikh mit einem schwarzen Bart, der fast bis zu seiner Schärpe herabreichte.\n",
      "Einen derart großen Menschen hatte ich bisher nur im Zirkus gesehen.\n",
      "Der andere war ein kleiner, dicker, runder Geselle mit einem großen gelben Turban, er trug ein Bündel in der Hand und war nur mit einem Stofftuch bekleidet.\n",
      "Er schien vor Furcht zu zittern, seine Hände zuckten, als hätte er Schüttelfrost, sein Kopf pendelte andauernd von links nach rechts und er hatte zwei kleine blitzende Augen wie eine Maus, die aus ihrem Loch hervorlugt.\n",
      "Mir wurde kalt um Herz bei dem Gedanken, ihn zu töten.\n",
      "Aber der Gedanke an den Schatz überwog und mein Herz wurde hart wie Stein.\n",
      "Als er mein hellhäutiges Gesicht sah, stieß er einen kleinen Freudenschrei aus und kam auf mich zugerannt.\n",
      "»›Helfen Sie, Sahib,‹ keuchte er, ›helfen Sie dem unglücklichen Händler Achmet.\n",
      "Ich bin quer durch Rajputan gereist, um Schutz im Fort von Agra zu suchen.\n",
      "Ich bin bestohlen, geschlagen und beschimpft worden, nur weil ich ein Freund der Company war.\n",
      "Gesegnet sei diese Nacht, in der ich endlich in Sicherheit komme – ich und meine geringer Besitz.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»›Was haben Sie in diesem Bündel,‹ fragte ich.\n",
      "»›Eine eiserne Kiste,‹ antwortete er, ›sie enthält die eine oder andere Sache aus unserem Familienbesitz, wertlos für jemand anderen, aber ich möchte sie nicht verlieren.\n",
      "Doch ich bin kein Bettler und kann Sie wohl belohnen, junger Sahib, auch Ihren Gouverneur, wenn er mir den erbetenen Schutz gewährt.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»Ich konnte es nicht aushalten, weiter mit dem Mann zu sprechen.\n",
      "Je länger ich sein fettes, verängstigtes Gesicht sah, desto schwerer wurde mir beim Gedanken, daß wir ihn gleich kaltblütig erschlagen würden.\n",
      "Es war am besten, es gleich hinter uns zu bringen.\n",
      "»›Bringt ihn zur Hauptwache,‹ sagte ich.\n",
      "Die zwei Sikhs nahmen ihn zwischen sich und der Riese ging hinterher, als sie in den dunklen Torweg hineinmarschierten.\n",
      "Selten war ein Mensch so vollständig von Tod umgeben.\n",
      "Ich blieb mit der Laterne im Tor stehen.\n",
      "»Ich hörte den Klang ihrer gemessenen Schritte durch die einsamen Gänge.\n",
      "Plötzlich verstummte er, ich hörte Stimmen, eine laute Rauferei und das Geräusch von Schlägen.\n",
      "Zu meinem Entsetzten kam dann das Geräusch hastiger Schritte, begleitet vom stoßartigen Atmen eines Rennenden auf mich zu.\n",
      "Ich richtete meine Laterne auf den langgestreckten Durchgang, und dort kam der dicke Mann in Windeseile angerannt, einen großen Blutstreifen quer über dem Gesicht.\n",
      "Direkt auf seinen Fersen und mit gewaltigen, tigerhaften Sprüngen folgte ihm der riesige schwarzbärtige Sikh, das blitzende Messer in der Hand.\n",
      "Nie zuvor hatte ich einen Menschen so schnell wie den kleinen Händler rennen gesehen.\n",
      "Sein Vorsprung zum Sikh vergrößerte sich, und wenn er mich erst passiert und das Freie gewonnen hätte, wäre er in Sicherheit gewesen.\n",
      "Ich hatte Mitleid mit ihm, aber wieder war es der Gedanke an den Schatz, der mich hart und unerbittlich machte.\n",
      "Als er an mir vorbeirannte, warf ich meine Flinte zwischen seine Beine und er überschlug sich zweifach wie ein angeschossenes Kaninchen.\n",
      "Bevor er wieder auf die Füße kam, war der Sikh über ihm und stieß ihm das Messer zweimal in die Seite.\n",
      "Der Mann gab nicht einmal ein Stöhnen von sich und bewegte keinen Muskel mehr.\n",
      "Er blieb genau an der Stelle liegen, wo er hingefallen war.\n",
      "Ich glaube, er hatte sich beim Fallen das Genick gebrochen.\n",
      "Gentlemen, Sie sehen, daß ich mein Versprechen halte.\n",
      "Ich erzähle Ihnen jede Einzelheit der Sache exakt wie sie geschehen ist, egal ob sie für oder gegen mich spricht.«\n",
      "Hier hielt er inne und streckte seine Hand nach einem Whisky-Soda aus, den Holmes für ihn gemixt hatte.\n",
      "Ich hatte zugegebenermaßen bereits eine äußerste Abscheu gegen diesen Mann entwickelt, nicht nur wegen der Kaltblütigkeit seiner Tat, sondern vielmehr aufgrund der schnoddrigen und teilnahmslosen Erzählweise.\n",
      "Welche Strafe ihm auch bevorstand, von mir konnte er keine Sympathie mehr erwarten.\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes und Jones saßen mit den Händen im Schoß da und folgten interessiert seiner Erzählung, aber auch in ihren Gesichtern waren Anzeichen von Abscheu zu sehen.\n",
      "Vielleicht hatte er dies bemerkt, denn er fuhr mit einem trotzigen Ton in der Stimme fort.\n",
      "»Das war alles sehr übel,« sagte er. »Ich möchte wissen, wieviel andere Gesellen den Anteil an der Beute ausgeschlagen hätten, wenn Skrupel auf der einen, und ein Schnitt durch die eigene Kehle auf der anderen Seite stehen.\n",
      "So stand mein Leben gegen sein Leben, sobald er das Fort betreten hatte.\n",
      "Wäre er entkommen, wäre die ganze Sache aufgedeckt worden und ich wäre vor das Standgericht gekommen und erschossen worden, denn die Leute waren damals nicht sehr nachsichtig.«\n",
      "»Erzählen Sie Ihre Geschichte weiter,« sagte Holmes kurz angebunden.\n",
      "»Nun, Abdullah, Akbar und ich trugen ihn hinein.\n",
      "Obwohl er so klein war, war er dennoch ganz schön schwer.\n",
      "Mahomet Singh wurde als Wache an der Tür belassen.\n",
      "Wir brachten ihn an eine Stelle, die von den Sikhs schon vorbereitet worden war.\n",
      "Sie lag ein Stück entfernt, dort wo ein gewundener Durchgang in eine große leere Halle führte, deren Backsteinwände schon abbröckelten.\n",
      "Der Fußboden hatte sich an einer Stelle gesenkt und eine Art natürliches Grab erzeugt.\n",
      "Dort ließen wir Achmet den Händler liegen, nachdem wir ihn mit losem Steinschutt bedeckt hatten.\n",
      "Als dies vollbracht war, gingen wir zum Schatz zurück.\n",
      "»Er lag genau dort, wo er ihn beim ersten Angriff fallengelassen hatte.\n",
      "Es war die gleiche Kiste, die Sie hier geöffnet auf dem Tisch liegen sehen.\n",
      "Am geschnitzten Griff des Deckels war ein seidenes Band befestigt, an dem ein Schlüssel hing.\n",
      "Wir öffneten die Kiste und im Licht der Laterne glitzerte eine Kollektion von Edelsteinen, so wie ich als kleiner Junge in Pershore immer darüber gelesen und davon geträumt hatte.\n",
      "Man war geblendet, wenn man sie ansah.\n",
      "Als wir uns satt gesehen hatten, nahmen wir sie alle heraus und machten eine Aufstellung darüber.\n",
      "Es waren einhundertunddreiundvierzig Diamanten erster Güte.\n",
      "Darunter auch einer, der ›Großer Mogul‹ genannt wird und der zweitgrößte existierende Diamant sein soll.\n",
      "Dann waren da neunundsiebzig sehr schöne Smaragde, einhundertundsiebzig Rubine – einige kleinere darunter.\n",
      "Weiter waren da vierzig Granatsteine, zweihundertzehn Saphire, einundsechzig Achate und eine große Zahl von Beryll, Onyx, Tigeraugen, Türkisen und anderen Steinen, deren Namen ich damals noch nicht kannte, über die ich mich heute aber auskenne.\n",
      "Und es waren noch dreihundert sehr wertvolle Perlen dabei, von denen zwölf in Gold gefaßt waren.\n",
      "Als ich die Kiste wiederfand, waren letztere jedoch herausgenommen worden.\n",
      "»Als wir unsere Schätze gezählt hatten, legten wir sie in die Kiste zurück und trugen sie zum Torweg, um sie Mahomet Singh zu zeigen.\n",
      "Dann erneuerten wir feierlich unseren Schwur, einander zu helfen und das Geheimnis zu wahren.\n",
      "Wir beschlossen gemeinsam, unsere Beute an einem sicheren Platz zu verstecken, um sie erst dann unter uns aufzuteilen, wenn das Land wieder zur Ruhe gekommen war.\n",
      "Sie sofort zu verteilen wäre unklug gewesen, da es im Fort keinen sicheren Platz gab und der Besitz solch kostbarer Juwelen sofort Verdächtigungen zur Folge gehabt hätte.\n",
      "Wir trugen die Kiste deshalb in die Halle, in der wir auch den Toten begraben hatten und machten ein Loch unterhalb der Steine in einer gut erhaltenen Wand.\n",
      "Wir merkten uns die Stelle genau und ich fertigte am nächsten Tag vier Pläne an, einen für jeden von uns und setzte das Zeichen der Vier darunter, denn wir hatten geschworen, nur gemeinsam vorzugehen, so daß niemand übervorteilt werden konnte.\n",
      "Für diesen Schwur lege ich auch heute meine Hand ins Feuer, denn ich habe ihn niemals gebrochen.\n",
      "»Was nach dem indischen Aufstand passierte, muß ich keinem der Gentlemen erzählen.\n",
      "Nachdem Wilson Delhi eingenommen hatte und Sir Coli Lucknow befreite, war der Widerstand gebrochen.\n",
      "Neue Truppen kamen ins Land und Nana Sahib entschwand über die Grenze.\n",
      "Eine fliegende Kolonne unter Colonel Greathead kam in Agra vorbei und vertrieb die Pandies.\n",
      "Der Friede schien wieder im Land einzukehren und wir vier hofften, daß bald die Zeit gekommen war, mit unserem Teil des Schatzes durchbrennen zu können.\n",
      "Innerhalb eines Momentes jedoch wurden unsere Hoffnungen zerstört, als wir als die Mörder von Achmet verhaftet wurden.\n",
      "»Es war folgendes geschehen: der Rajah gab seine Juwelen in Achmets Obhut, weil er ihn als seinen Vertrauten sehr gut kannte.\n",
      "Die Asiaten sind jedoch sehr mißtrauisch.\n",
      "Also setzte er einen zweiten, noch vertrauteren Diener als Spion auf den ersten an.\n",
      "Dem zweiten wurde befohlen, Achmet niemals aus den Augen zu lassen und er folgte ihm wie ein Schatten.\n",
      "Auch in jener Nacht war er ihm gefolgt und sah ihn durch den Torweg hindurchgehen.\n",
      "Natürlich glaubte er, Achmet hätte Zuflucht im Fort gefunden, bat am nächsten Tag um Eintritt ins Fort und konnte keine Spur von Achmet finden.\n",
      "Da es ihm merkwürdig vorkam, sprach er darüber mit einem Sergeant der Wache, und dieser brachte es vor den Kommandanten.\n",
      "Schnell wurde eine gründliche Suche durchgeführt und der Tote entdeckt.\n",
      "Und gerade als wir uns sicher fühlten, wurde wir alle vier festgenommen und des Mordes angeklagt – drei von uns, da wir in jener Nacht das Tor bewacht hatten, der vierte, weil er als Begleiter des Ermordeten gesehen worden war.\n",
      "Im Prozeß wurden die Juwelen mit keinem Wort erwähnt, denn der Rajah war entthront und aus Indien vertrieben worden; und niemand sonst konnte sie vermissen.\n",
      "Der Mord war aber eindeutig und wir alle mußten daran beteiligt gewesen sein.\n",
      "Die drei Sikhs erhielten eine lebenslange Zuchthausstrafe, ich wurde zum Tode verurteilt; allerdings wurde mein Strafmaß später in das gleiche wie bei den anderen umgewandelt.\n",
      "»Wir befanden uns in einer eigenartigen Situation.\n",
      "Alle vier mit Ketten an den Füßen und ohne die geringste Chance des Entkommens.\n",
      "Und doch bewahrte jeder von uns ein Geheimnis, das uns sofort in einen Palast versetzen könnte, wenn wir es preisgeben würden.\n",
      "Es war zum Verücktwerden.\n",
      "Man mußte sich von jedem noch so niedrigen Wärter treten lassen, mußte Reis essen und Wasser trinken, wo doch das gewaltige Vermögen draußen nur darauf wartete, daß wir es uns nahmen.\n",
      "Es hätte mich verrückt machen können, aber ich war schon immer stur, so hielt ich mich wacker und saß meine Zeit ab.\n",
      "»Und dann schien sie gekommen zu sein.\n",
      "Ich wurde von Agra nach Madras verlegt und von dort nach Blair Island auf den Andamanen.\n",
      "Es gab nur wenige weiße Verbrecher in dieser Kolonie.\n",
      "Da ich mich von Anfang an ordentlich benahm, war ich bald eine privilegierte Person.\n",
      "Ich erhielt eine Hütte in Hope Town, einem kleinen Ort an den Hängen des Mount Harriet.\n",
      "Man ließ mich dort allein leben.\n",
      "Es war ein düsterer, fieberverseuchter Ort und außerhalb unserer Rodung hausten wilde eingeborene Kannibalen, die uns nur allzu gern mit ihren vergifteten Pfeilen beschossen, wenn sie nur eine Gelegenheit dazu fanden.\n",
      "Den ganzen Tag waren wir mit Graben, Roden und dem Pflanzen von Yams beschäftigt; doch am Abend hatten wir ein wenig Zeit für uns selbst.\n",
      "So lernte ich unter anderem, Medikamente für unseren Arzt auszuteilen und habe dabei von seinem Wissen einiges erlernt.\n",
      "Ich war immer auf der Suche nach einer Fluchtmöglichkeit.\n",
      "Doch das Festland war hunderte von Meilen entfernt und es gab kaum oder nur sehr wenig Wind auf dem Meer.\n",
      "Die Flucht war fürchterlich schwer.\n",
      "»Der Arzt, Dr. Somerton, war ein sportbegeisterter junger Mann.\n",
      "Abends kamen andere jüngere Offiziere in sein Zimmer und spielten Karten mit ihm.\n",
      "Das Behandlungszimmer, in dem ich die Medikamente zusammenstellte, hatte ein Fenster zu seinem Wohnzimmer.\n",
      "Oft, wenn ich mich langweilte, machte ich die Lampe im Zimmer aus und konnte ihre Gespräche hören und das Kartenspiel beobachten.\n",
      "Ich bin selbst ein begeisterter Kartenspieler und das Zusehen war fast so gut wie das Mitspielen.\n",
      "Anwesend waren Major Sholto, Captain Morstan und Lieutenant Bromley Brown, sie alle befehligten die eingeborenen Truppen.\n",
      "Dann war der Arzt dabei, sowie zwei oder drei Angestellte des Gefängnisses, listige alte Jungens, die ein nettes, schlaues und sicheres Spiel liebten.\n",
      "Sie gaben eine gemütliche kleine Gesellschaft ab.\n",
      "»Bald schon bemerkte ich verwundert, daß die Soldaten immer verloren und die Zivilisten immer gewannen.\n",
      "Ich sage nicht, daß dabei etwas unfair war, aber es war so.\n",
      "Seit sie auf den Andamanen waren, hatten die Leute vom Gefängnis nichts anderes getan, als Karten zu spielen; und sie kannten die Spielweise ihrer Kameraden recht gut.\n",
      "Die anderen spielten nur zum Zeitvertreib und warfen die Karten schnell hin.\n",
      "Jede Nacht wurden die Soldaten ärmer, und je ärmer sie wurden, desto schärfer waren sie auf ein neues Spiel.\n",
      "Major Sholto war der Schlimmste.\n",
      "Zuerst bezahlte er mit Geldscheinen und mit Gold, aber dann kam es zu Schuldscheinen über große Summen.\n",
      "Manchmal gewann er einige Runden, als sollte er bei Laune gehalten werden.\n",
      "Doch dann verließ ihn das Glück noch mehr als je zuvor.\n",
      "Tagsüber wanderte er wutschnaubend herum und trank mehr als ihm gut tat.\n",
      "»Eines Abends verlor er noch mehr als gewöhnlich.\n",
      "Ich saß in meiner Hütte, als er und Captain Morstan auf dem Weg zu ihrer Wohnung an mir vorbeistolperten.\n",
      "Die beiden waren Busenfreunde und man sah sie nie weit voneinander entfernt.\n",
      "Der Major ereiferte sich über seine Verluste.\n",
      "»Als sie meine Hütte passierten, sagte er: ›Es ist aus, Morstan.\n",
      "Ich muß um Entlassung bitten.\n",
      "Ich bin ruiniert.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»›Unsinn, alter Junge!\n",
      "‹ sagte der andere und schlug ihm auf die Schulter.\n",
      "›Ich habe auch eine Pechsträhne gehabt, aber –‹.\n",
      "Das war alles, was ich hören konnte.\n",
      "Aber es hatte mich auf einen Gedanken gebracht.\n",
      "»Einige Tage später schlenderte Major Sholto am Strand entlang und ich nahm die Gelegenheit wahr, ihn anzusprechen.\n",
      "»›Ich möchte einen Rat von Ihnen haben, Major,‹ sagte ich.\n",
      "»›Nun Small, was gibt es?\n",
      "‹ fragte er und nahm seinen Zigarrenstumpen aus dem Mund.\n",
      "»›Sir, ich möchte Sie folgendes fragen,‹ sagte ich.\n",
      "›Wer wäre der Richtige, um einen versteckten Schatz zu melden.\n",
      "Ich weiß, wo eine halbe Million liegt.\n",
      "Und da ich sie selber nicht verwenden kann, wäre es das beste, wenn ich sie der richtigen Behörde übergebe.\n",
      "Vielleicht wird dann meine Strafe verkürzt.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»›Eine halbe Million, Small?\n",
      "‹ Er schnappte nach Luft und sah mich an, ob ich es ernst meinte.\n",
      "»›So ist es, Sir – in Juwelen und in Perlen.\n",
      "Es liegt für jedermann bereit.\n",
      "Und das Verrückte ist, daß der wahre Besitzer geächtet ist und es nicht beanspruchen kann.\n",
      "So gehört es dem Ersten, der es nimmt.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»›Der Regierung, Small,‹ stammelte er, ›– der Regierung‹.\n",
      "Aber er sagte es mit Zögern und ich wußte nun, daß ich ihn gepackt hatte.\n",
      "»›Sie meinen also, Sir, ich soll die Information dem Generalgouverneur geben?\n",
      "‹ fragte ich ruhig.\n",
      "»›Nun, Sie müssen nichts Unbesonnenes tun, etwas, das Sie bereuen könnten.\n",
      "Erzählen Sie mir alles, Small.\n",
      "Geben Sie mir die Fakten.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»Ich erzählte ihm die ganze Geschichte, machte aber kleine Änderungen, damit er die Orte nicht identifizieren konnte.\n",
      "Als ich fertig war, stand er stocksteif und in Gedanken da.\n",
      "Am Zucken seiner Lippen konnte ich sehen, daß in seinem Innern ein Kampf stattfand.\n",
      "»›Das ist eine sehr wichtige Sache, Small,‹ sagte er zuletzt.\n",
      "›Sie sollten keinem ein Wort davon erzählen.\n",
      "Wir werden uns bald wieder sehen.\n",

      "»Zwei Tage später kamen er und sein Freund Captain Morstan in stockfinsterer Nacht mit einer Laterne an meine Hütte.\n",
      "»›Ich möchte, daß auch Captain Morstan die Geschichte aus Ihrem Munde hört, Small,‹ sagte er.\n",
      "»Und so erzählte ich sie genau wie zuvor.\n",
      "»›Ist sie wahr?\n",
      "‹ sagte er.\n",
      "›Ist sie gut genug, um darauf zu reagieren?\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»Captain Morstan nickte.\n",
      "»›Sehen Sie, Small,‹ sagte der Major.\n",
      "›Wir haben darüber gesprochen, mein Freund und ich.\n",
      "Und wir sind zum Entschluß gekommen, daß ihr Geheimnis keine Sache der Regierung ist, es ist eher Ihre private Sache.\n",
      "Sie sollten es also so regeln, wie Sie es für richtig halten.\n",
      "Nun aber die Frage, was wäre es Ihnen wert?\n",
      "Wir könnten den Fall aufnehmen und uns darum kümmern, wenn wir uns über die Bedingungen einigen könnten.\n",
      "‹ Er versuchte, in einer ruhigen und nachlässigen Art zu sprechen, aber seine Augen schimmerten vor Aufregung und Gier.\n",
      "»›Wenn es so ist, Gentlemen,‹ antwortete ich und versuchte ebenfalls, ruhig zu sein, obwohl ich genauso aufgeregt war, wie er.\n",
      "›Ein Mann in meiner Position kann nur einen einzigen Handel abschließen.\n",
      "Ich möchte, daß Sie mir und meinen drei Gefährten zur Freiheit verhelfen.\n",
      "Dann nehmen wir Sie in unsere Gemeinschaft auf und geben Ihnen ein Fünftel, das Sie unter sich aufteilen.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»›Hmm!\n",
      "‹ sagte er.\n",
      "›Ein Fünftel!\n",
      "Das ist nicht so lohnend.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»›Es wären fünfzigtausend für jeden,‹ sagte ich.\n",
      "»›Aber wie sollen wir Sie freibekommen?\n",
      "Sie wissen, daß Sie um etwas Unmögliches bitten.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»›Nicht im geringsten,‹ antwortete ich.\n",
      "›Ich habe es bis ins letzte Detail durchdacht.\n",
      "Das einzige Hindernis zu unserer Flucht ist die Tatsache, daß wir kein für die Reise ausgerüstetes Boot finden können.\n",
      "Und nicht ausreichend Proviant für eine so lange Reise.\n",
      "In Kalkutta oder Madras gibt es genügend kleine Yachten oder Yawls, die für unser Vorhaben geeignet sind.\n",
      "Bringen Sie eine hierher.\n",
      "Wir werden in der Nacht an Bord gehen und wenn Sie uns an irgendeiner Stelle an der indischen Küste rauswerfen, haben Sie ihren Teil der Abmachung erfüllt.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»›Wenn es nur einer wäre,‹ sagte er.\n",
      "»›Alle oder keiner,‹ antwortete ich.\n",
      "›Wir haben es geschworen.\n",
      "Wir vier müssen immer gemeinsam handeln.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»›Sehen Sie, Morstan,‹ sagte er, ›Small steht zu seinem Wort.\n",
      "Er steht zu seinen Freunden.\n",
      "Ich glaube, wir können ihm wohl trauen.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»›Es ist ein schmutziges Geschäft,‹ sagte der andere.\n",
      "›Aber wie Sie schon sagten, das Geld würde unsere Verpflichtungen mehr als genug decken.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»›Ich denke, Small,‹ sagte der Major, ›wir müssen es versuchen und Ihnen entgegenkommen.\n",
      "Natürlich müssen wir erst den Wahrheitsgehalt Ihrer Geschichte überprüfen.\n",
      "Sagen Sie mir, wo die Kiste liegt, und ich nehme Urlaub und fahre mit dem monatlich kommenden Versorgungsboot nach Indien und untersuche die Sache.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»›Nicht so schnell,‹ sagte ich und wurde ebenso kalt wie er heiß geworden war.\n",
      "›Ich brauche die Zustimmung meiner drei Kameraden.\n",
      "Ich sagte bereits, alle oder keiner.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»›Unsinn!\n",
      "‹ unterbrach er mich.\n",
      "›Was haben die drei schwarzen Kerle mit unserer Abmachung zu tun?\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»›Schwarz oder blau,‹ sagte ich, ›sie sind dabei und wir gehen zusammen.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "»Nun, das ganze endete mit einer zweiten Versammlung, an der Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan und Dost Akbar teilnahmen.\n",
      "Wir besprachen die Sache noch einmal und kamen zum Schluß zu einer Übereinkunft.\n",
      "Wir würden beiden Offizieren eine Karte von Agra geben und den Ort markieren, an dem der Schatz versteckt war.\n",
      "Major Sholto sollte nach Indien fahren und die Geschichte überprüfen.\n",
      "Falls er die Box fände sollte er sie dort belassen und eine kleine Yacht für die Reise ausrüsten.\n",
      "Sie sollte vor Rutland Island ankern.\n",
      "Er kehrt zum Dienst zurück und wir schlagen uns zum Boot durch.\n",
      "Dann sollte Captain Morstan seinen Urlaub nehmen und uns in Agra treffen.\n",
      "Dort würde der Schatz endgültig geteilt und er nähme seinen und des Majors Anteil.\n",
      "Dies alles wurde unter den ernstesten Schwüren, die sich der Verstand ausdenken und die Lippen aussprechen konnten, besiegelt.\n",
      "Ich war die ganze Nacht mit Papier und Tinte beschäftigt und am Morgen hatte ich die beiden Karten fertig, unterschrieben mit dem Zeichen der Vier – von Abdullah, Akbar, Mahomet und von mir.\n",
      "»Nun, Gentlemen, ich ermüde Sie sicher mit meiner langen Geschichte und weiß, daß mein Freund Mr. Jones ungeduldig darauf wartet, mich ins Kittchen zu bringen.\n",
      "Ich werde mich kurz fassen.\n",
      "Der Schurke Sholto reiste nach Indien und kam nie mehr zurück.\n",
      "Captain Morstan zeigte mir kurz darauf seinen Namen auf der Passagierliste eines Postschiffes.\n",
      "Sein Onkel war gestorben und hatte ihm ein Vermögen vererbt, und so verließ er die Armee.\n",
      "Wie konnte er nur derart gemein sein, und uns fünf so behandeln.\n",
      "Kurz darauf fuhr Morstan hinüber nach Agra und fand das Versteck leer, genau wie wir es erwartet hatten.\n",
      "Der Schuft hatte alles gestohlen ohne auch nur eine Bedingung zu erfüllen, unter der wir ihm das Geheimnis verraten hatten.\n",
      "Seit jener Zeit sann ich nur noch auf Rache.\n",
      "Tagsüber dachte ich daran und nachts träumte ich davon.\n",
      "Es wurde zu einer mich beherrschenden Leidenschaft.\n",
      "Das Gesetz interessierte mich nicht – auch nicht der Galgen.\n",
      "Zu entkommen, Sholto zu verfolgen und meine Hand an seinem Hals zu spüren – dies waren meine einzigen Gedanken.\n",
      "Selbst der Agra-Schatz war in meinen Gedanken weniger wert als das Töten von Sholto.\n",
      "»Nun, ich hatte mir in meinem bisherigen Leben viel vorgenommen und alles auch ausgeführt.\n",
      "Aber es waren beschwerliche Jahre, bevor endlich meine Zeit gekommen war.\n",
      "Ich erzählte bereits, daß ich einiges über Medizin gelernt hatte.\n",
      "Als eines Tages Dr. Somerton mit Malaria zu Bett lag, wurde ein kleiner Andamanen-Bursche von einer Gruppe Strafgefangener im Wald gefangengenommen.\n",
      "Er war todkrank und hatte sich eine einsame Stelle zum Sterben gesucht.\n",
      "Ich nahm ihn in Pflege, obwohl er so giftig wie eine junge Schlange war, und nach einigen Monaten war er gesund und konnte wieder laufen.\n",
      "Er hatte Zuneigung zu mir gewonnen, wollte absolut nicht in den Dschungel zurück und trieb sich in der Nähe meiner Hütte herum.\n",
      "Ich hatte ein wenig von seiner Sprache gelernt, dies machte ihn noch anhänglicher.\n",
      "»Tonga – so war sein Name – war ein guter Bootsmann.\n",
      "Ihm gehörte ein großes, geräumiges Kanu.\n",
      "Als ich seine Ergebenheit erkannte, sah ich meine Gelegenheit zur Flucht gekommen, denn er würde alles für mich tun.\n",
      "Ich sprach mit ihm darüber.\n",
      "Er sollte das Boot in der Nacht an einen unbewachten Landungssteg bringen und mich dort aufnehmen.\n",
      "Ich gab ihm Anweisungen, mehrere Kürbisflaschen mit Wasser, sowie genügend Yamswurzeln, Kokusnüsse und Süßkartoffeln mitzubringen.\n",
      "»Der kleine Tonga war treu und zuverlässig.\n",
      "Man kann sich keinen treueren Gehilfen vorstellen.\n",
      "Zur angegebenen Nacht war sein Boot am Steg.\n",
      "Zufälligerweise war in jener Nacht ein Gefangenenaufseher dort – ein schrecklicher Pathane, der nie eine Gelegenheit ausgelassen hatte, mich zu beleidigen und zu verletzen.\n",
      "Ich hatte immer Rache geschworen, und nun war die Gelegenheit gekommen.\n",
      "Es war, als ob das Schicksal ihn mir zugeführt hatte, damit ich meine Schuld begleichen konnte, bevor ich die Insel verließ.\n",
      "Er stand mit dem Rücken zu mir am Ufer, den Karabiner über der Schulter.\n",
      "Ich suchte nach einem Stein, um ihm den Kopf einzuschlagen, konnte aber keinen finden.\n",
      "Da kam mir ein verrückter Gedanke, wie ich zu einer Waffe kommen könnte.\n",
      "Ich setzte mich in der Dunkelheit hin und band mir das Holzbein ab.\n",
      "Mit drei schnellen Sprüngen war ich bei ihm.\n",
      "Er riß den Karabiner von seiner Schulter, aber ich traf ihn voll und zerschlug ihm das Gesicht.\n",
      "Sie sehen hier noch den Sprung an der Stelle im Holz, wo ich ihn traf.\n",
      "Da ich mein Gleichgewicht verlor, fielen wir beide hin, aber er blieb für immer liegen.\n",
      "Ich begab mich zum Boot und eine Stunde später waren wir unversehrt auf See.\n",
      "Tonga hatte all seine irdischen Besitztümer mitgebracht, seine Waffen und seine Götzen.\n",
      "Unter anderem hatte er einen langen Bambusspeer und einige Kokosmatten dabei, aus denen ich eine Art Segel machte.\n",
      "Zehn Tage trieben wir in der See herum und vertrauten unserem Glück.\n",
      "Am elften Tag wurde wir von einem Handelsschiff aufgenommen, das mit einer Ladung malaiischer Pilger von Singapur nach Jiddah fuhr.\n",
      "Es war eine komische Truppe, aber Tonga und ich konnten uns bald zwischen ihnen niederlassen.\n",
      "Sie hatten eine gute Eigenschaft: sie ließen uns in Ruhe und stellten keine Fragen.\n",
      "»Ich kann Ihnen nicht alle Abenteuer erzählen, die mein kleiner Freund und ich durchstehen mußten.\n",
      "Sonst säßen wir noch bei Tageslicht hier.\n",
      "Wir trieben auf der Welt hierhin und dorthin, irgendetwas hielt uns immer davon ab, nach London zu kommen.\n",
      "Aber ich hatte die ganze Zeit mein Ziel nicht aus den Augen verloren.\n",
      "Nachts träumte ich von Sholto.\n",
      "Ich habe ihn hundertmal im Schlaf ermordet.\n",
      "Endlich, vor etwa drei oder vier Jahren, kamen wir doch nach England.\n",
      "Es war nicht schwierig herauszufinden, wo Sholto lebte und ich begann zu erforschen, ob er den Schatz zu Geld gemacht hatte oder ob er ihn noch immer besaß.\n",
      "Ich befreundete mich mit jemandem, der mir dabei helfen konnte – ich nenne keinen Namen, denn ich möchte ihn nicht auch ins Loch wandern sehen – und fand bald heraus, daß er die Juwelen noch besaß.\n",
      "Dann versuchte ich, auf verschiedene Weise an ihn heranzukommen.\n",
      "Aber er war sehr schlau und hatte immer zwei Preisboxer zur Bewachung, außerdem seine Söhne und seinem Khitmutgar.\n",
      "»Eines Tages erhielt ich jedoch die Nachricht, daß er im Sterben liege.\n",
      "Ich eilte sofort in seinen Garten, voller Furcht, er könnte mir so einfach aus den Fängen entkommen.\n",
      "Ich schaute durchs Fenster und sah ihn in seinem Bett liegen, die Söhne an seiner Seite.\n",
      "Ich hätte es auch mit allen Dreien aufgenommen, als ich plötzlich sein Kinn herunterfallen sah.\n",
      "Da wußte ich, daß er tot war.\n",
      "In der gleichen Nacht stahl ich mich in sein Zimmer und suchte in seinen Papieren nach einem Hinweis, wo er die Juwelen versteckt haben könnte.\n",
      "Doch ich fand keine Zeile und mußte verbittert und enttäuscht den Ort verlassen.\n",
      "Doch zuvor überlegte ich, ob ich nicht ein Zeichen der Rache hinterlassen sollte, das meine Sikh-Freunde erfreut hätte, sollte ich sie jemals wiedersehen.\n",
      "So kritzelte ich das Zeichen von uns Vieren auf die Karte und befestigte sie an seiner Brust.\n",
      "Es wäre ungerecht gewesen, wenn er zu Grabe getragen würde ohne irgendein Zeichen der Männer, die er genarrt und bestohlen hatte.\n",
      "»In jener Zeit verdienten wir unseren Lebensunterhalt, indem ich Tonga auf Ausstellungen und an anderen Orten als den schwarzen Kannibalen vorführte.\n",
      "Er mußte rohes Fleisch essen und einen Kriegstanz zeigen.\n",
      "So hatten wir am Ende des Tages eine Handvoll Pennies in Hut.\n",
      "Ich erhielt noch immer die Nachrichten von Pondicherry Lodge, aber für einige Jahre war nichts Neues zu erfahren, außer daß man immer noch nach dem Schatz suchte.\n",
      "Dann endlich kam die Nachricht, auf die wir so lange gewartet hatten.\n",
      "Der Schatz war gefunden worden.\n",
      "Er war im Dach des Hauses, in Mr. Bartholomews Chemielaboratorium.\n",
      "Ich ging sofort hin, um mir den Ort anzusehen, fand aber keine Möglichkeit, mit meinem Holzbein dort hinauf zu gelangen.\n",
      "Ich erfuhr aber etwas über die Falltür und über Mr. Sholto's Uhrzeit des Abendessens.\n",
      "Ich glaubte, dies leicht durch Tonga erledigen zu können.\n",
      "Ich nahm ihn mit und band ihm ein langes Tau um die Hüften.\n",
      "Er konnte wie eine Katze klettern und war schnell auf dem Dach.\n",
      "Unglücklicherweise und zu seinem Schaden war Mr. Sholto noch im Zimmer.\n",
      "Tonga glaubte, etwas sehr Kluges getan zu haben, als er ihn tötete.\n",
      "Als ich das Seil hinaufkam, lief er wie ein stolzer Pfau herum.\n",
      "Er war sehr überrascht, als ich ihn mit dem Tauende schlug und ihn als blutrünstigen Kobold verfluchte.\n",
      "Ich nahm die Schatzkiste und ließ erst sie und dann mich am Seil hinunter.\n",
      "Vorher machte ich aber das Zeichen der Vier auf dem Tisch, um anzuzeigen, daß die rechtmäßigen Besitzer zurückgekommen waren.\n",
      "Tonga zog dann das Seil herauf, schloß das Fenster und machte sich auf demselben Weg von dannen, wie er gekommen war.\n",
      "»Ich glaube, mehr brauche ich Ihnen nicht zu erzählen.\n",
      "Ich hatte einen Seemann über die Schnelligkeit der Aurora erzählen gehört und dachte, es sei das richtige Boot zur Flucht.\n",
      "Ich wurde mit dem alten Smith handelseinig und versprach ihm eine hohe Belohnung, wenn er uns sicher auf unser Schiff bringen würde.\n",
      "Er wußte zweifellos, daß etwas faul daran war, aber er erfuhr nichts über unser Geheimnis.\n",
      "Und wenn ich Ihnen hier die Wahrheit erzähle, ist es nicht, um Sie gut zu amüsieren, Gentlemen – denn andersherum haben Sie mir nicht Gutes gebracht –, sondern meine beste Verteidigung kann nur sein, nichts auszulassen.\n",
      "Die ganze Welt soll wissen, wie schlecht ich von Sholto behandelt worden bin und wie unschuldig ich am Tod seines Sohnes.«\n",
      "»Ein bemerkenswerter Fall,« sagte Holmes. »Und eine passende Auflösung dazu.\n",
      "Im letzten Teil Ihrer Erzählung habe ich nichts Neues erfahren, außer daß Sie Ihr eigenes Seil mitbrachten.\n",
      "Das wußte ich nicht.\n",
      "Ich hatte übrigens gehofft, daß Tonga alle seine Pfeile verschossen hatte, aber er hat noch einen vom Schiff aus auf uns abgeschossen.«\n",
      "»Er hatte sie alle verloren, Sir.\n",
      "Aber einer steckte noch im Blasrohr.«\n",
      "»Oh, natürlich,« sagte Holmes. »Daran hatte ich nicht gedacht.«\n",
      "»Gibt es noch einen anderen Punkt, über den Sie Auskunft wünschen?« fragte der Gefangene leutselig.\n",
      "»Danke, ich glaube nicht,« antwortete mein Begleiter.\n",
      "»Nun, Holmes,« sagte Athelney Jones, »Sie sind ein humorvoller Mensch und wir wissen alle, daß sie ein Liebhaber von Verbrechen sind.\n",
      "Aber Pflicht ist Pflicht und ich bin sehr weit mit dem gegangen, um das Sie mich gebeten hatten.\n",
      "Ich würde mich viel wohler fühlen, wenn wir unseren Geschichtenerzähler endlich hinter Schloß und Riegel hätten.\n",
      "Der Wagen und zwei Inspektoren warten noch immer unten auf uns.\n",
      "Ich danke Ihnen beiden für Ihre Hilfe.\n",
      "Natürlich wird man Sie vor Gericht brauchen.\n",
      "Ich wünsche Ihnen eine gute Nacht.«\n",
      "»Ihnen beiden Gute Nacht, Gentlemen,« sagte auch Jonathan Small.\n",
      "»Sie gehen voran, Small,« befahl der vorsichtige Jones beim Verlassen des Zimmers. »Ich werde genau aufpassen, daß Sie mich mit Ihrem Holzbein nicht so wie den Mann auf den Andamanen niederknüppeln können.«\n",
      "»So, das ist nun das Ende unseres kleinen Dramas,« bemerkte ich, nachdem wir einige Zeit still geraucht hatten. »Ich fürchte, dies war die letzte Ermittlung, bei der ich Ihre Methoden studieren konnte.\n",
      "Miss Morstan hat mir die Ehre gegeben und mich als zukünftigen Ehemann akzeptiert.«\n",
      "Er stieß einen düsteren Seufzer aus.\n",
      "»Das habe ich befürchtet,« sagte er. »Ich kann Ihnen wirklich nicht gratulieren.«\n",
      "Ich war ein wenig gekränkt.\n",
      "»Sind Sie mit meiner Wahl unzufrieden?« fragte ich.\n",
      "»Keineswegs.\n",
      "Sie ist eine der charmantesten jungen Damen, die ich je kennengelernt habe und könnte uns bei solchen Arbeiten wohl unterstützen, wie wir sie bisher gemacht haben.\n",
      "Sie hat eine unzweifelhafte Geschicklichkeit dabei: denken Sie daran, wie sie diese Agra-Karte von allen anderen Papieren ausgewählt und aufbewahrt hatte.\n",
      "Aber die Liebe ist eine emotionale Sache und steht im Gegensatz zur kalten Logik, die ich über alle anderen Dinge stelle.\n",
      "Ich werde nie heiraten, denn ich fürchte die Beeinflussung meines Urteilsvermögens.«\n",
      "»Ich vertraue darauf,« rief ich lachend, »daß mein Urteilsvermögen die Probe besteht.\n",
      "Aber Sie sehen müde aus.«\n",
      "»Ja, es wirkt schon bei mir.\n",
      "Ich werde mich eine Woche lang wie ein schlapper Feudel fühlen.«\n",
      "»Seltsam,« sagte ich, »wie sich etwas, das ich bei anderen Menschen Faulheit nennen würde, bei Ihnen abwechselt mit Anfällen von extremer Energie und Kraft.«\n",
      "»Ja,« sagte er, »in mir gibt es Anlagen für einen guten Faulenzer und auch für einen lebhaften Typen.\n",
      "Ich denke oft an diese Zeilen vom alten Goethe:\n",
      "›Schade, daß die Natur nur einen Mensch aus Dir schuf,\n",
      "Denn zum würdigen Mann war und zum Schelmen der Stoff.\n",
      "‹\n",
      "Um noch einmal auf den Norwood Fall zurückzukommen: Sie sehen, daß sie, wie ich schon vermutete, einen Verbündeten im Hause hatten.\n",
      "Dies kann kein anderer als der Butler Lal Rao sein.\n",
      "Jones hat also nur einen Teil der Beute in seinem Netz gefangen.«\n",
      "»Eine Teilung scheint mir ungerecht,« antwortete ich. »Sie haben die meiste Arbeit an diesem Fall geleistet.\n",
      "Ich bekomme eine Ehefrau, Jones erhält die Ehre, was bleibt da für Sie?«\n",
      "»Mir bleibt das Kokain-Fläschchen,« sagte Sherlock Holmes und streckte seine lange weiße Hand danach aus.\n"
